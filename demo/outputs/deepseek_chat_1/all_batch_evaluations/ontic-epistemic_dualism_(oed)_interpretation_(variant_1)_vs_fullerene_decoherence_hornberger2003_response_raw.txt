Here is the analysis of the experiment using the Ontic-Epistemic Dualism (OED) interpretation:

{"derivation": "Step 1: Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of C70 molecules. Using λ = h/p = h/(m*v), where m = 840 amu = 1.395e-24 kg, v = 100 m/s, h = 6.626e-34 Js. λ = (6.626e-34)/(1.395e-24*100) = 4.75e-12 m. Step 2: Determine the Talbot length for the interferometer. The Talbot length is given by L_T = d^2/λ, where d = 990 nm is the grating period. L_T = (990e-9)^2/(4.75e-12) = 0.206 m. Step 3: Calculate the decoherence time scale due to thermal radiation. Using Γ_env = (8π^5/15)*k_B^5*T^5*α^2/(ℏ^4*c^4), where T = 900 K, α = 4πϵ_0R^3 for C70 (R ≈ 0.5 nm), and other constants. This evaluates to Γ_env ≈ 1.2e6 s^-1. Step 4: Compute the effective reality coherence parameter Γ_eff = Γ + ℏ*Γ_env*t_int, where t_int = L_T/v = 0.206/100 = 2.06 ms. Γ_eff = 0 + (1.054e-34)*(1.2e6)*(2.06e-3) = 2.6e-31 J = 1.6e-12 eV. Step 5: Apply the OED measurement rule P(a) = κ|⟨a|Ψ_epi⟩|² + (1-κ)|⟨a|Ψ_ont⟩|². For fringe visibility V, we model it as V = V_max*exp(-Γ_eff*t_int/ℏ) = exp(-2.6e-31*2.06e-3/1.054e-34) ≈ exp(-5.08e-6) ≈ 1 - 5.08e-6. Step 6: The final visibility is nearly unity because Γ_eff is extremely small (Γ=0 in this variant), showing minimal ontic-epistemic decoupling in high vacuum."}

The derivation shows:
1) The massive C70 molecules have extremely small de Broglie wavelength
2) The Talbot-Lau interferometer configuration gives macroscopic fringe spacing
3) Thermal decoherence is negligible in high vacuum at 900K for this massive molecule
4) With Γ=0 in this variant, the ontic and epistemic layers remain perfectly coupled
5) The fringe visibility remains nearly perfect (V≈1) as the system stays quantum coherent

The key OED insight is that the fringe visibility directly measures the synchronization between the ontic reality (quantum interference pattern) and epistemic knowledge (observed fringe contrast), which remains maximal in this case due to weak environmental coupling.
