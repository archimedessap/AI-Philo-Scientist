Here is the analysis of the experiment using the Ontic-Epistemic Duality Interpretation (OEDI):

{"derivation": "Step 1: Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of C70 fullerene. Using \\lambda_{dB} = h/p = h/(m\\cdot v), where m = 840 \\text{ amu} = 1.395 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg}, v = 100 \\text{ m/s}, we get \\lambda_{dB} = 4.74 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m}. Step 2: Determine the Talbot length L_T = d^2/\\lambda_{dB}, where d = 990 \\text{ nm} is the grating period. This gives L_T = 0.207 \\text{ m}. Step 3: Calculate the thermal decoherence time \\tau_D using the environment temperature T = 900 K. From OEDI, the decoherence rate is \\Gamma_D = \\frac{m^2 k_B T \\sigma^2}{\\hbar^2}, where \\sigma is the system size (taken as grating period d). This yields \\Gamma_D = 1.21 \\times 10^9 \\text{ s}^{-1}, giving \\tau_D = 8.26 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ s}. Step 4: Compute the interferometer transit time \\tau_{transit} = L_T/v = 2.07 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ s}. Step 5: The fringe visibility V is given by the OEDI measurement rule as V = \\exp(-\\Gamma_D \\tau_{transit}) \\cdot |\\langle \\Psi_{ontic}|\\Psi_{epistemic} \\rangle|^2. With \\lambda_{OE} = 0 (no coupling), the overlap term is 1, leaving V = \\exp(-2.50 \\times 10^6) \\approx 0."}

The derivation shows:
1) The massive C70 molecule has an extremely small de Broglie wavelength
2) The Talbot-Lau interferometer configuration gives macroscopic separation
3) Decoherence dominates due to the high temperature environment
4) The OEDI predicts complete loss of fringe visibility because:
   - The ontic component (quantum potential) decoheres completely
   - The epistemic component cannot maintain coherence without coupling (λ_OE=0)
   - The generalized Born rule reduces to standard decoherence in this limit

The zero visibility prediction matches standard quantum decoherence theory for this experiment, but with the OEDI providing additional interpretation about the interplay between the physical decoherence (Ψ_ontic) and information loss (Ψ_epistemic).
