{"derivation": "Step 1: Initialize the system with a single photon entering the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The initial state is described by the ontic wavefunction $\\Psi_{ontic} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)$, where $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ represent the two paths. The epistemic wavefunction $\\Psi_{epistemic}$ is initially identical to $\\Psi_{ontic}$, representing maximal knowledge about the system. Step 2: The photon evolves under the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H} = \\hat{H}_{QM} + \\lambda_{OE}\\hat{H}_{int}$, where $\\hat{H}_{QM}$ describes the standard quantum mechanical evolution in the interferometer and $\\hat{H}_{int} = -\\frac{\\hbar_k^2}{2}\\nabla_k^2 + V(\\Psi_{ontic}, \\Psi_{epistemic})$ couples the ontic and epistemic components. Since $\\lambda_{OE} = 0$, the interaction term vanishes, and the two wavefunctions evolve independently. Step 3: The quantum RNG triggers the choice to insert or remove the output beam splitter after the photon has entered the interferometer. This corresponds to a measurement process where $\\lambda_{OE} \\rightarrow 1$, activating the interaction Hamiltonian. The measurement probability is given by the generalized Born rule $P = |\\langle\\Psi_{ontic}|\\Psi_{epistemic}\\rangle|^2$. Step 4: For the delayed choice scenario, the ontic wavefunction has already evolved to include interference effects, while the epistemic wavefunction updates to reflect the new measurement basis. The fringe visibility $V$ is calculated as $V = \\frac{P_{max} - P_{min}}{P_{max} + P_{min}}$, where $P_{max}$ and $P_{min}$ are the maximum and minimum probabilities of detecting the photon at the output ports. Step 5: Since the ontic wavefunction retains interference terms regardless of the delayed choice, and the epistemic wavefunction updates to match, the fringe visibility remains high. The exact value is derived from the overlap integral $V = |\\langle\\Psi_{ontic}|\\Psi_{epistemic}\\rangle|^2 = 1$, indicating perfect visibility."}
