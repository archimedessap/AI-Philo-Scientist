Here is the analysis of the electron double-slit experiment using the Ontic-Epistemic Duality Interpretation (OEDI):

{"derivation": "Step 1: Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of electrons. Using the relativistic formula for 50 keV electrons: \\[ \\lambda_{dB} = \\frac{h}{p} = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2m_e e V(1 + \\frac{eV}{2m_e c^2})}} \\approx 5.36 \\times 10^{-12}\\,m \\] where $V = 50\\,kV$, $m_e$ is electron mass, and $e$ is electron charge. Step 2: Determine the interference pattern spacing. For a biprism setup (analogous to double-slit with separation $d$), the fringe spacing is: \\[ \\Delta x = \\frac{\\lambda_{dB} L}{d} \\] where $L = 1.5\\,m$ is screen distance. Step 3: Compute fringe visibility in OEDI framework. The generalized visibility is: \\[ V = |\\langle \\psi_{ontic}|\\psi_{epistemic} \\rangle|^2 \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - e^{-D/\\lambda_{OE}}} \\] where $D$ is decoherence factor and $\\lambda_{OE}$ is the ontic-epistemic coupling length. For this pristine experiment (no decoherence), $D \\approx 0$ and $\\lambda_{OE} \\rightarrow \\infty$ (since $\\lambda_{OE} = 0$ in parameters), giving maximum visibility. Step 4: The pure quantum interference pattern gives visibility: \\[ V = \\left| \\int \\psi_{ontic}^*(x)\\psi_{epistemic}(x)dx \\right|^2 = 1 \\] as the ontic and epistemic wavefunctions perfectly overlap in this ideal case."}

``` 

The derivation shows:
1) Standard calculation of electron wavelength
2) Interference pattern geometry
3) Application of OEDI's generalized visibility formula 
4) Perfect visibility results from complete overlap between ontic quantum potential and epistemic knowledge states in this idealized setup, with zero decoherence and maximal coupling ($\lambda_{OE}=0$ allows perfect information transfer). The theory predicts the same perfect visibility as standard QM but through its dual-aspect mechanism.
