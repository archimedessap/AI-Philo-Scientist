Here is the analysis of the electron double-slit experiment using the Ontic-Epistemic Dualism (OED) interpretation:

{"derivation": "Step 1: Identify the experimental parameters from the setup. The electron energy is 50 keV, which corresponds to a de Broglie wavelength \\(\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p} = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2m_eE}} \\approx 5.36 \\times 10^{-12}\\) m. Step 2: The fringe visibility in a double-slit experiment is given by \\(V = |\\langle \\psi_{ont}|\\psi_{epi} \\rangle|\\), where \\(|\\psi_{ont}\\rangle\\) is the ontic wavefunction (physical reality) and \\(|\\psi_{epi}\\rangle\\) is the epistemic wavefunction (observer knowledge). Step 3: For the biprism setup, the ontic wavefunction is a superposition of two paths: \\(|\\psi_{ont}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\psi_1\\rangle + |\\psi_2\\rangle)\\), where \\(|\\psi_1\\rangle\\) and \\(|\\psi_2\\rangle\\) correspond to the two paths. Step 4: The epistemic wavefunction is constrained by the knowledge balance parameter \\(\\kappa\\). For maximal knowledge (\\(\\kappa = 1\\)), \\(|\\psi_{epi}\\rangle = |\\psi_{ont}\\rangle\\), leading to perfect fringe visibility \\(V = 1\\). Step 5: The reality coherence parameter \\(\\Gamma\\) mediates the coupling between the ontic and epistemic layers. For \\(\\Gamma = 0\\), the layers are decoupled, and the fringe visibility is given by \\(V = \\kappa\\). Step 6: Combining these, the predicted fringe visibility is \\(V = \\kappa = 1\\) for the given parameters."}
