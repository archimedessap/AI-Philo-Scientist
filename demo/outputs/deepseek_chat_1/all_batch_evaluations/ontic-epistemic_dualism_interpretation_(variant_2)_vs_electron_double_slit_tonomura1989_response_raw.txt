{"derivation": "Step 1: Identify the ontic field evolution. The electron's ontic field \u03a8 evolves unitarily under the Hamiltonian \\(\\hat{H}_{ontic} = \\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2m} + V(\\hat{x})\\), where \\(V(\\hat{x})\\) represents the biprism potential. For 50 keV electrons, the de Broglie wavelength is \\(\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p} = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2mE_k}}\\), where \\(E_k = 50 \\text{ keV} = 8.01 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ J}\\). Step 2: Calculate \\(\\lambda\\). Using \\(m_e = 9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\text{ kg}\\) and \\(h = 6.63 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ Js}\\), we get \\(\\lambda = \\frac{6.63 \\times 10^{-34}}{\\sqrt{2 \\times 9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\times 8.01 \\times 10^{-15}}} = 5.49 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m}\\). Step 3: Epistemic projection. The fringe visibility \\(V\\) is determined by the coherence of the epistemic state \\(\\psi\\), which is a projection of \u03a8 constrained by \\(I_{max}\\). For perfect coherence (no decoherence), \\(V = 1\\). Step 4: Decoherence correction. The generalized Born rule introduces a decoherence factor \\(e^{-\\beta E_i}\\), but since \\(\\beta = 0\\) and \\(I_{max} = 0\\) in the given parameters, no decoherence occurs. Thus, \\(V\\) remains maximal. Step 5: Final prediction. The experiment's fringe visibility is theoretically 1 (perfect interference), as the ontic field's coherence is fully preserved in the epistemic projection under these parameters."}
