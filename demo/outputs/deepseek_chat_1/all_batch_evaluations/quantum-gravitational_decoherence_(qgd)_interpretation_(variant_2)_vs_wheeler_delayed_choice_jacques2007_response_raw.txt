{"derivation": "Step 1: Identify the gravitational self-energy difference $E_G$ between the two paths in the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. For single photons, the gravitational self-energy difference is negligible ($E_G \\approx 0$) because the photon's energy is too small to create significant spacetime curvature. Thus, $\\tau_G \\sim \\hbar/E_G \\rightarrow \\infty$. Step 2: The decoherence term in the state equation $\\frac{d\\hat{\\rho}}{dt} = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar}[\\hat{H}, \\hat{\\rho}] - \\frac{1}{2\\tau_G}[\\hat{E}_G, [\\hat{E}_G, \\hat{\\rho}]]$ vanishes because $\\tau_G \\rightarrow \\infty$. The evolution is purely unitary: $\\frac{d\\hat{\\rho}}{dt} = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar}[\\hat{H}, \\hat{\\rho}]$. Step 3: The delayed choice (quantum RNG) determines whether the output beam splitter is present. If present, the system evolves unitarily to produce interference (fringe visibility $V=1$). If absent, the which-path information is preserved ($V=0$). Step 4: Since $E_G \\approx 0$, the gravitational decoherence does not suppress interference. The fringe visibility is determined solely by the experimental configuration: $V = \\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}} = 1$ when interference occurs."}
