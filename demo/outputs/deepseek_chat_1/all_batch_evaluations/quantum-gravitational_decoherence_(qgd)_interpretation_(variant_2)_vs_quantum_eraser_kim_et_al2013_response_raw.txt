{"derivation": "Step 1: Identify the gravitational self-energy difference operator \\(\\hat{E}_G\\) for the photon pairs. For polarization-entangled photons, the gravitational self-energy difference between orthogonal polarization states is negligible (\\(E_G \\approx 0\\)) because their mass-energy distributions are identical. Thus, \\(\\tau_G \\sim \\hbar/E_G \\rightarrow \\infty\\). Step 2: Apply the state equation from the theory: \\(\\frac{d\\hat{\\rho}}{dt} = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar}[\\hat{H}, \\hat{\\rho}] - \\frac{1}{2\\tau_G}[\\hat{E}_G, [\\hat{E}_G, \\hat{\\rho}]]\\). Since \\(\\tau_G \\rightarrow \\infty\\), the decoherence term vanishes, leaving only unitary evolution: \\(\\frac{d\\hat{\\rho}}{dt} = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar}[\\hat{H}, \\hat{\\rho}]\\). Step 3: The fringe visibility \\(V\\) is determined by the coherence of the system. With no decoherence (\\(\\tau_G \\rightarrow \infty\\)), full interference is preserved: \\(V = \\frac{I_{\\text{max}} - I_{\\text{min}}}{I_{\\text{max}} + I_{\\text{min}}} = 1\\). Step 4: The eraser method (delayed-choice measurement) does not affect \\(V\\) in this theory because the gravitational decoherence mechanism is inactive (\\(E_G = 0\\)). The which-path information is irrelevant to \\(V\\) as the system remains coherent. Step 5: Conclusion: The theory predicts maximum fringe visibility regardless of the eraser or which-path information, as the gravitational decoherence channel is inactive for photons."}
