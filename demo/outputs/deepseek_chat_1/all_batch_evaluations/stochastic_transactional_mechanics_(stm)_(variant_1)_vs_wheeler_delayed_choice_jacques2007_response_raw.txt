{"derivation": "Step 1: The experiment involves a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a delayed choice mechanism. In Stochastic Transactional Mechanics (STM), the photon's behavior is governed by both stochastic trajectories and transactional wave exchanges. The initial state of the photon is a superposition of paths in the interferometer: \\[|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\text{path}_1\\rangle + |\\text{path}_2\\rangle)\\] where $|\\text{path}_1\\rangle$ and $|\\text{path}_2\\rangle$ represent the two arms of the interferometer. Step 2: The delayed choice is implemented by an electro-optic modulator (EOM) that inserts or removes the output beam splitter after the photon has entered the interferometer. The choice is determined by a quantum RNG, which is treated as a stochastic process in STM. The stochastic field $\\xi(t)$ influences the transactional potential, modifying the probability of transaction completion. The transactional potential is given by \\[\\psi_i^* \\cdot \\psi = \\langle \\psi_i | \\psi \\rangle\\] where $\\psi_i^*$ is the advanced wave component for transaction $i$. Step 3: The fringe visibility $V$ is determined by the interference pattern formed by the transactional completion probabilities. In STM, the probability of a transaction completing at a point $x$ is \\[P(x) = |\\psi(x)|^2 \\exp(-\\lambda_s |x - x_0|^2)\\] where $\\lambda_s = 0$ (pure transactional interpretation) implies no stochastic localization. Thus, the interference pattern is purely determined by the wavefunction overlap. Step 4: For a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, the output intensity is \\[I(\\phi) = I_0 \\cos^2(\\phi/2)\\] where $\\phi$ is the phase difference between the two paths. The fringe visibility is defined as \\[V = \\frac{I_{\\text{max}} - I_{\\text{min}}}{I_{\\text{max}} + I_{\\text{min}}}\\] Substituting the intensity expression, we get \\[V = \\frac{\\cos^2(0) - \\cos^2(\\pi/2)}{\\cos^2(0) + \\cos^2(\\pi/2)} = \\frac{1 - 0}{1 + 0} = 1\\] Step 5: Since $\\lambda_s = 0$, the stochastic field does not localize the transaction, and the fringe visibility remains maximal, i.e., $V = 1$. The delayed choice does not affect the visibility because the transactional interpretation is time-symmetric, and the advanced wave components ensure consistent interference regardless of the choice timing."}
