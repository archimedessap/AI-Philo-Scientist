Here is the analysis and derivation using the Stochastic Transactional Interpretation (STI):

{"derivation": "Step 1: Define the transactional potential field for entangled photons. For polarization-entangled photons in the Bell state |Ψ⁻⟩ = (|HV⟩ - |VH⟩)/√2, the transactional potential field is ψ(r₁,r₂,t) = ψ_HV(r₁,t)ψ_VH(r₂,t) - ψ_VH(r₁,t)ψ_HV(r₂,t). Step 2: Incorporate the stochastic terms. The state evolves according to dψ = [-iĤ/ħ + λ_N∇² + √(λ_T)ξ(r,t)]ψ dt. For photons, we neglect the kinetic term and focus on the polarization entanglement: dψ = [√(λ_T)ξ(r,t)]ψ dt. Step 3: Calculate the correlation function. The measurement correlation for polarizers at angles a and b is E(a,b) = ∫ ψ* σ·a ⊗ σ·b ψ dV = -cos[2(a-b)] + λ_T ∫ ξ(r,t)cos[2(a-b)]dt. Step 4: Compute the CHSH S-value. Using angles (0°, 22.5°, 45°, 67.5°), S = |E(a,b) - E(a,b') + E(a',b) + E(a',b')|. Substituting the correlation function: S = 2√2 + 4λ_T ∫ ξ(r,t)dt. Step 5: Evaluate the stochastic term. For a completed transaction (τ → ∞), the noise integral ∫ ξ(r,t)dt → 0 due to the non-local cancellation of fluctuations. Thus S = 2√2."}

The derivation shows:
1. The basic entangled state is modified by the stochastic transactional field
2. The correlation function gains a noise-dependent term
3. For completed transactions, the noise averages to zero
4. The final S-value matches standard QM prediction (2√2 ≈ 2.83)
5. The non-local cancellation of ξ(r,t) reflects the time-symmetric nature of transactions in STI

Key STI concepts used:
- Transactional potentials mediating the entanglement
- Noise field ξ(r,t) representing stochastic elements
- Transaction completion suppressing fluctuations
- Non-local correlation through the λ_T term
