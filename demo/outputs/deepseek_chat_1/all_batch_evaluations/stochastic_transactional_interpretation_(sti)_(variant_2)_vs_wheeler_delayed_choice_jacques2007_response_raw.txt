{"derivation": "Step 1: The experiment involves a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a delayed choice mechanism. In the Stochastic Transactional Interpretation (STI), the photon's behavior is governed by both stochastic mechanics (SM) and transactional interpretation (TI) components. The Hamiltonian is given by: \\(H = H_{SM} + \\alpha H_{TI} = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x) + \\alpha \\int \\psi^*(x)W(x,x')\\psi(x')dxdx'\\). Here, \\(H_{SM}\\) describes the photon's stochastic motion, and \\(H_{TI}\\) mediates non-local wavefunction coupling via the transactional kernel \\(W(x,x')\\). \n\nStep 2: The state evolution is described by the stochastic equation: \\(d\\psi = [-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}H_{SM}dt + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\sigma_t}}dW_t]\\psi + H_{TI}\\psi dt\\). The term \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\sigma_t}}dW_t\\) introduces stochastic fluctuations, while \\(H_{TI}\\psi dt\\) accounts for transactional interactions. \n\nStep 3: The delayed choice is implemented via a quantum RNG after the photon enters the interferometer. In STI, this corresponds to a stochastic transaction completing on a timescale \\(\\sigma_t = 0.1s\\). The probability of a transaction (measurement outcome) is given by \\(|\\psi|^2\\) weighted by the local stochastic coupling strength \\(\\alpha = 1.0\\). \n\nStep 4: For fringe visibility, we calculate the interference pattern arising from the superposition of offer and confirmation waves. The transactional kernel \\(W(x,x')\\) ensures non-local coupling between the two paths of the interferometer. The visibility \\(V\\) is determined by the overlap integral of the wavefunctions: \\(V = \\left| \\int \\psi_1^*(x)\\psi_2(x)dx \\right|\\), where \\(\\psi_1\\) and \\(\\psi_2\\) are the wavefunctions for the two paths. \n\nStep 5: Assuming perfect beam splitters and no decoherence, the wavefunctions for the two paths are identical in magnitude but differ by a phase \\(\\phi\\). Thus, \\(V = \\left| e^{i\\phi} \\right| = 1\\). The stochastic component does not degrade visibility because the transactional coupling \\(\\alpha = 1.0\\) ensures complete interference. \n\nStep 6: The delayed choice does not affect the visibility because the transaction (measurement) is completed after the photon has already traversed both paths, and the stochastic coupling preserves the interference pattern."}
