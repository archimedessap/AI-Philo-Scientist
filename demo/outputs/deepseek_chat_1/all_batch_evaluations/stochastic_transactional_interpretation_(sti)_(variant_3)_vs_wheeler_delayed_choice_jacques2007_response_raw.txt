{"derivation": "Step 1: The experiment involves a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a delayed choice (quantum RNG) to insert/remove the output beam splitter after the photon has entered. In STI, this corresponds to a time-symmetric transactional process where the photon's trajectory is influenced by both local stochastic noise (λ_N) and non-local transactional correlations (λ_T). The transactional potential field ψ combines the offer wave (forward in time) and confirmation wave (backward in time). Step 2: The Hamiltonian includes the transactional coupling term: \\hat{H} = \\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2m} + V(\\hat{x}) + λ_T \\int ψ^\\dagger(\\mathbf{r},t)ψ(\\mathbf{r},t+τ)d^3\\mathbf{r}. For a single photon, V(\\hat{x}) represents the interferometer potential, and the λ_T term mediates non-local correlations between the photon's entry and the delayed choice. Step 3: The state evolution is given by dψ = \\left[-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\hat{H} + λ_N \\nabla^2 + \\sqrt{λ_T}ξ(\\mathbf{r},t)\\right]ψ dt. Since λ_N = 0 and λ_T = 0 in the given parameters, the evolution reduces to the standard unitary evolution with no stochastic or transactional noise. Step 4: The measurement rule states that the probability of a transaction completing is the normalized overlap of offer and confirmation waves. For a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, the overlap is maximal (1) when the output beam splitter is present, leading to interference, and minimal (0.5) when it is absent, leading to no interference. Step 5: The fringe visibility V is given by V = (I_max - I_min)/(I_max + I_min). With the beam splitter present, I_max = 1, I_min = 0 → V = 1. With it absent, I_max = I_min = 0.5 → V = 0. The delayed choice averages these: V = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 0 = 0.5."}
