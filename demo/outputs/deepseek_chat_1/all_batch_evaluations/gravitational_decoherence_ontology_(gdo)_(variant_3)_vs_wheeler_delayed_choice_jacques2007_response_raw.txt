{"derivation": "Step 1: The experiment involves a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a delayed choice mechanism. The photon's wavefunction enters the interferometer and splits into two paths (|0⟩ and |1⟩). The gravitational decoherence term in the Hamiltonian is \\hat{H}_{grav} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\Lambda_G}\\int |\\nabla\\psi(\\mathbf{r})|^2 d^3\\mathbf{r} + V_{grav}(\\hat{\\rho}), where \\Lambda_G is the gravitational decoherence scale. Step 2: The Lindblad operator for gravitational decoherence is \\hat{L}_k = \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{\\Lambda_G c^4}}\\hat{\\rho}_k. For a single photon, the density operator \\hat{\\rho}_k is proportional to the mass distribution, which is negligible for a photon. Thus, \\hat{L}_k|\\psi\\rangle \\approx 0. Step 3: Since \\tau_d = 0, the decoherence is purely gravitational. The photon's mass is negligible, so V_{grav}(\\hat{\\rho}) \\approx 0. The Hamiltonian reduces to \\hat{H} \\approx \\hat{H}_{QM}, the standard quantum Hamiltonian. Step 4: The delayed choice is made after the photon enters the interferometer, but since gravitational decoherence is negligible, the wavefunction evolves unitarily. The output beam splitter's insertion/removal is a quantum operation that does not decohere the state. Step 5: The fringe visibility V is given by V = |\\langle \\psi_0 | \\psi_1 \\rangle|, where |\\psi_0\\rangle and |\\psi_1\\rangle are the states on the two paths. For a balanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer, V = 1 when the beam splitter is present, and V = 0 when it is removed. The quantum RNG ensures a 50% chance of each case, so the expected visibility is V = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 0 = 0.5."}
