Here is the analysis of the quantum eraser experiment using the Ontic-Epistemic Dualism (OED) interpretation:

{"derivation": "Step 1: Initialize the dual-layered state for polarization-entangled photon pairs. The ontic state |Ψ_ont⟩ describes the physical entanglement, while the epistemic state |Ψ_epi⟩ represents the measurable knowledge about polarization. For the entangled state, we write: |Ψ_ont⟩ = (|H⟩_1|V⟩_2 + |V⟩_1|H⟩_2)/√2, where H/V denote horizontal/vertical polarization. The epistemic state mirrors this but represents knowledge: |Ψ_epi⟩ = (|K_H⟩_1|K_V⟩_2 + |K_V⟩_1|K_H⟩_2)/√2, where K_H/K_V denote knowledge of H/V polarization. Step 2: Model the double-slit tagging. The slits impart orthogonal polarizations (e.g., slit A → H, slit B → V). This creates which-path information in the ontic layer: |Ψ_ont⟩ → (|H⟩_A|V⟩_B + |V⟩_A|H⟩_B)/√2. The epistemic layer remains unchanged until measurement. Step 3: Apply the measurement rule. The observed fringe visibility V is given by the interference term in P(a) = κ|⟨a|Ψ_epi⟩|² + (1-κ)|⟨a|Ψ_ont⟩|². For the eraser case (interference restored), the epistemic term dominates (κ→1) and we recover full visibility. For no eraser (which-path info present), the ontic term dominates (κ→0) and visibility vanishes. Step 4: Calculate using given parameters. With Γ = 0 eV (no decoherence) and κ = 1 (maximal knowledge balance), the eraser measurement fully restores interference. The visibility V is given by the coherence term in the epistemic density matrix: V = |Tr(ρ_epi σ_+)| = 1, where σ_+ is the raising operator for the interference basis. For the no-eraser case, V = 0 since the ontic density matrix ρ_ont is diagonal in the which-path basis."}
