Here is the analysis of the quantum eraser experiment using the Stochastic Transactional Interpretation (STI) variant 2:

{"derivation": "Step 1: The experiment involves polarization-entangled photon pairs, where the double-slit paths are tagged by orthogonal polarizations (|H⟩ and |V⟩). The initial entangled state is |Ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(|H⟩₁|V⟩₂ + |V⟩₁|H⟩₂). Step 2: The transactional kernel W(x,x') for polarization entanglement is W(x,x') = ⟨H|V⟩₂⟨V|H⟩₂ = 0 (orthogonal), but when the eraser measurement is performed (delayed-choice), the effective kernel becomes W_eff(x,x') = α⟨H|R(θ)|V⟩₂⟨V|R(θ)|H⟩₂ where R(θ) is the EOM-controlled polarization rotation. Step 3: The fringe visibility V is given by the modulus of the transactional amplitude: V = |∫ψ*(x)W_eff(x,x')ψ(x')dxdx'| / (∫|ψ(x)|²dx). Step 4: For perfect erasure (θ = 45°), R(45°)|H⟩ = (|H⟩+|V⟩)/√2 and R(45°)|V⟩ = (-|H⟩+|V⟩)/√2, making W_eff(x,x') = α/2. Step 5: The stochastic coupling modifies this as V = α/(1+σ_t/Δt) where Δt is the measurement time window (≈1ns for typical EOM switching). Using α=1.0 and σ_t=0.1s, V ≈ 1/(1+0.1/1e-9) ≈ 1 - 1e-10 ≈ 1.0."}
{"value": 1.0}

The derivation shows how the STI predicts full fringe visibility when the which-path information is erased, with the stochastic transaction timescale σ_t having negligible effect for typical experimental time windows. The key elements are:
1) The transactional kernel W encodes the non-local polarization correlations
2) The eraser measurement modifies W through the polarization rotation R(θ)
3) The stochastic coupling α and timescale σ_t slightly modify the ideal TI prediction
4) For realistic parameters, the prediction matches standard quantum mechanics (V=1)
