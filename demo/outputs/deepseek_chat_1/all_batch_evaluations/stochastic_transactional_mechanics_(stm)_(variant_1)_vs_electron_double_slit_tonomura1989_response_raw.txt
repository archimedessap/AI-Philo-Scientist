Here is the analysis of the experiment using Stochastic Transactional Mechanics (STM):

{"derivation": "Step 1: Calculate de Broglie wavelength \\(\\lambda_{dB} = \\frac{h}{p}\\) where \\(p = \\sqrt{2m_e e V}\\) (V=50kV). Substituting values: \\(\\lambda_{dB} = \\frac{6.626\\times10^{-34}}{\\sqrt{2(9.11\\times10^{-31})(1.6\\times10^{-19})(50\\times10^3)}} = 5.49\\times10^{-12}\\) m. Step 2: In STM, the interference pattern arises from completed transactions between retarded (\\(\\psi\\)) and advanced (\\(\\psi^*\\)) waves. The stochastic field modifies the standard Born rule as \\(P(x) = |\\psi(x)|^2 e^{-\\lambda_s |x-x_0|^2}\\). Since \\(\\lambda_s = 0\\) (pure TI), this reduces to standard interference \\(P(x) = |\\psi_1 + \\psi_2|^2\\). Step 3: For biprism interference, the wavefunction at screen is \\(\\psi(x) = \\psi_1 e^{ikr_1} + \\psi_2 e^{ikr_2}\\) where \\(r_{1,2} = \\sqrt{L^2 + (x\\mp d/2)^2}\\) (L=1.5m, d=slit separation). Step 4: Using small-angle approximation, phase difference is \\(\\Delta\\phi \\approx \\frac{2\\pi d x}{\\lambda_{dB} L}\\). Intensity becomes \\(I(x) = I_0 \\cos^2(\\frac{\\pi d x}{\\lambda_{dB} L})\\). Step 5: Fringe visibility \\(V = \\frac{I_{max}-I_{min}}{I_{max}+I_{min}} = 1\\) for perfect coherence (no stochastic localization)."}

Key points:
1. With \\(\\lambda_s=0\\), we recover pure transactional interpretation results
2. The stochastic field doesn't localize the pattern in this parameter regime
3. The derivation shows how transactions between advanced/retarded waves maintain full coherence
4. Numerical result matches standard quantum prediction for perfect interference
