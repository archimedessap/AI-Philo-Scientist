Here is the analysis of the experiment using the Quantum-Gravitational Decoherence (QGD) Interpretation:

{"derivation": "Step 1: Calculate the electron's de Broglie wavelength \\lambda_{dB} = h/p, where p = \\sqrt{2m_e e V} (non-relativistic approximation for 50 kV acceleration).

The derivation shows that:
1) The electron's quantum wavelength dominates the interference pattern
2) The gravitational self-energy difference between paths is astronomically small (~10^-65 J)
3) The resulting decoherence time (~10^30 s) is vastly longer than the experimental timescale
4) Thus, fringe visibility remains essentially perfect (Vâ‰ˆ1) as observed in Tonomura's experiment
5) This aligns with the theory's prediction that gravitational decoherence only becomes significant for much more massive systems
