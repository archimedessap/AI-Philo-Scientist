{"derivation": "Step 1: The initial state of the electron can be described by a wavefunction \\( \\psi(x) \\) that evolves according to the Schr√∂dinger equation: \\[ i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\psi(x, t) = H_{QM} \\psi(x, t) \\] where \\( H_{QM} = \\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2m} + V(x) \\). For a free electron, we can ignore the potential term, leading to the free particle Hamiltonian. \\[ H_{QM} = \\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2m} \\] Step 2: The wavefunction evolves as \\[ \\psi(x, t) = e^{-i\\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2m\\hbar}t} \\psi(x, 0) \\] where \\( \\psi(x, 0) \\) is the initial wavefunction. Step 3: In the double-slit experiment, the electron passes through two slits, creating a superposition of states. The wavefunction after passing through the slits can be expressed as: \\[ \\psi(x) = \\psi_1(x) + \\psi_2(x) \\] where \\( \\psi_1 \\) and \\( \\psi_2 \\) are the wavefunctions corresponding to the electron passing through slit 1 and slit 2, respectively. Step 4: The probability density for detecting the electron on the screen is given by the square of the absolute value of the wavefunction: \\[ P(x) = |\\psi(x)|^2 = |\\psi_1(x) + \\psi_2(x)|^2 = |\\psi_1(x)|^2 + |\\psi_2(x)|^2 + 2\\text{Re}(\\psi_1^*(x)\\psi_2(x)) \\] Step 5: The interference term, \\( 2\\text{Re}(\\psi_1^*(x)\\psi_2(x)) \\), is responsible for the fringe visibility. The visibility \\( V \\) of the interference pattern is defined as: \\[ V = \\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}} \\] where \\( I_{max} \\) and \\( I_{min} \\) are the maximum and minimum intensities of the interference pattern. Step 6: For a double-slit experiment, the visibility can be expressed in terms of the coherence of the wavefunctions: \\[ V = \\frac{2|\\langle \\psi_1, \\psi_2 \\rangle|}{|\\psi_1|^2 + |\\psi_2|^2} \\] Step 7: Assuming the slits are identical and the wavefunctions are coherent, we can simplify this to: \\[ V = \\frac{2}{1 + 1} = 1 \\] Step 8: The final fringe visibility for this experiment is therefore predicted to be 1, indicating perfect visibility of the interference fringes."}
