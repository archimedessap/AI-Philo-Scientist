To analyze the given experiment using the principles of the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics, we will follow a structured approach to derive the predicted value for fringe visibility in the context of decoherence.

### Step 1: Understanding the Experimental Setup
The experiment involves a C70 fullerene (840 amu) passing through a Talbot–Lau interferometer with a grating period of 990 nm. The fullerene is moving with an average velocity of 100 m/s in a high vacuum environment with a thermal source at 900 K.

### Step 2: Wavefunction Evolution
The initial state of the fullerene can be described by a wavefunction \(\psi(x, t=0)\). According to the Schrödinger equation, the time evolution of this wavefunction is governed by the Hamiltonian \(H_{QM}\):

\[
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi(x, t) = H_{QM} \psi(x, t)
\]

Where the Hamiltonian for a free particle (ignoring potential for simplicity) is given by:

\[
H_{QM} = \frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m}
\]

Here, \(\hat{p} = -i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\) is the momentum operator, and \(m\) is the mass of the fullerene.

### Step 3: Initial Wavefunction
Assuming the fullerene is initially in a coherent state, we can express the initial wavefunction as a Gaussian wave packet:

\[
\psi(x, 0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sigma \sqrt{\pi}}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{4\sigma^2}} e^{ik_0 x}
\]

Where \(\sigma\) is the width of the wave packet, and \(k_0\) is the wave number related to the average momentum \(p_0 = mv\):

\[
k_0 = \frac{p_0}{\hbar} = \frac{mv}{\hbar}
\]

### Step 4: Time Evolution
The time evolution of the wavefunction can be computed using the free particle solution:

\[
\psi(x, t) = \int K(x, x', t) \psi(x', 0) dx'
\]

Where \(K(x, x', t)\) is the propagator given by:

\[
K(x, x', t) = \sqrt{\frac{m}{2\pi i \hbar t}} e^{\frac{im(x - x')^2}{2\hbar t}}
\]

### Step 5: Decoherence and Fringe Visibility
In the context of decoherence, the interaction of the fullerene with the environment (thermal source at 900 K) leads to the loss of coherence between the paths in the interferometer. The fringe visibility \(V\) can be expressed as:

\[
V = \frac{I_{\text{max}} - I_{\text{min}}}{I_{\text{max}} + I_{\text{min}}}
\]

Where \(I_{\text{max}}\) and \(I_{\text{min}}\) are the maximum and minimum intensities of the interference pattern, respectively.

### Step 6: Estimating Fringe Visibility
The visibility can be affected by the decoherence time \(\tau_d\), which is influenced by the temperature of the environment. The decoherence time can be estimated using:

\[
\tau_d \approx \frac{\hbar}{k_B T}
\]

Where \(k_B\) is the Boltzmann constant and \(T\) is the temperature in Kelvin. For \(T = 900 \, \text{K}\):

\[
\tau_d \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \times 900 \, \text{K}} \approx 8.5 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 7: Calculating Visibility
The visibility \(V\) can be approximated as:

\[
V \approx e^{-\frac{t}{\tau_d}}
\]

Where \(t\) is the time the fullerene spends in the interferometer. Assuming the time \(t\) is on the order of the time it takes to traverse the grating (which can be estimated from the grating period and velocity):

\[
t \approx \frac{L}{v} \quad \text{(where \(L\) is the effective length of the interferometer)}
\]

For a rough estimate, if \(L \approx 1 \, \text{m}\):

\[
t \approx \frac{1 \, \text{m}}{100 \, \text{m/s}} = 0.01 \, \text{s}
\]

Now substituting into the visibility equation:

\[
V \approx e^{-\frac{0.01}{8.5 \times 10^{-14}}} \approx e^{-117647.06} \approx 0
\]

### Final Output
The fringe visibility is extremely low due to the significant decoherence caused by the thermal environment.
