{"derivation": "Step 1: In the quantum eraser experiment, we start with a pair of polarization-entangled photons. The state of the system can be represented as \\( |\\Psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|HH\\rangle + |VV\\rangle) \\), where \\( |H\\rangle \\) and \\( |V\\rangle \\) represent horizontal and vertical polarization states, respectively. This state encodes the potentialities of both photons. \\n\\nStep 2: When the photons pass through the double slit, they can be tagged by their polarization states. The double slit setup can be described by the wavefunction evolution governed by the Hamiltonian \\( H_{QM} \\). The slits are effectively marked by the polarization states, leading to the following state after passing through the slits: \\( |\\Psi_{slit}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|H_{slit}\\rangle |H\\rangle + |V_{slit}\\rangle |V\\rangle) \\). \\n\\nStep 3: If we measure which-path information (i.e., the polarization states), the interference pattern is destroyed, and the visibility of the fringes is given by \\( V = 0 \\). This is because the measurement collapses the wavefunction to a definite state, as per the projection postulate. \\n\\nStep 4: In the delayed-choice scenario, if we choose to erase the which-path information by measuring the polarization of the partner photon in a basis that does not distinguish between the paths (e.g., diagonal polarization states), we can restore the interference pattern. The state can be rewritten as \\( |\\Psi_{erase}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|D\\rangle |D\\rangle + |A\\rangle |A\\rangle) \\), where \\( |D\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|H\\rangle + |V\\rangle) \\) and \\( |A\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|H\\rangle - |V\\rangle) \\). \\n\\nStep 5: The visibility of the interference pattern can be calculated using the formula for fringe visibility, which is given by \\( V = \\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}} \\). In the case of the quantum eraser, when the which-path information is erased, we can expect \\( I_{max} = 1 \\) and \\( I_{min} = 0 \\), leading to \\( V = \\frac{1 - 0}{1 + 0} = 1 \\). \\n\\nStep 6: Therefore, the predicted fringe visibility for the quantum eraser experiment is \\( V = 1 \\), indicating complete restoration of the interference pattern when the which-path information is erased."}
