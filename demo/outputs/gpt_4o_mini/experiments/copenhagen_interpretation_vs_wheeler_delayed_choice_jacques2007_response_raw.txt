{"derivation": "Step 1: In the Mach–Zehnder interferometer, a single photon enters the first beam splitter (BS1), which creates a superposition of paths. The state of the photon after BS1 can be expressed as: \\[ \\psi = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|A\\rangle + |B\\rangle) \\] where |A⟩ and |B⟩ represent the two possible paths.\\n\\nStep 2: The photon travels through the paths A and B, and then encounters the second beam splitter (BS2). The action of BS2 on the superposition state leads to interference. The state after BS2 is given by: \\[ \\psi_{out} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|C\\rangle + |D\\rangle) \\] where |C⟩ and |D⟩ are the output paths.\\n\\nStep 3: The choice device (electro-optic modulator) can either insert or remove an output beam splitter. If the beam splitter is present, the photon will interfere, leading to a certain fringe visibility. If it is absent, the photon will take a definite path, leading to no interference.\\n\\nStep 4: The visibility of the interference fringes is defined as: \\[ V = \\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}} \\] where I_{max} and I_{min} are the maximum and minimum intensities of the interference pattern.\\n\\nStep 5: In the case where the choice device is set to allow interference (i.e., the beam splitter is present), the photon exhibits wave-like behavior, and we can calculate the intensities as follows: \\[ I_{max} = |\\langle C | \\psi_{out} \\rangle|^2 = \\left| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\] and \\[ I_{min} = |\\langle D | \\psi_{out} \\rangle|^2 = \\left| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\] thus, \\[ V = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - 0}{\\frac{1}{2} + 0} = 1 \\] indicating perfect visibility.\\n\\nStep 6: If the choice device is set to remove the beam splitter, the photon behaves like a particle, and we have: \\[ I_{max} = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad I_{min} = 0 \\] leading to \\[ V = \\frac{1 - 0}{1 + 0} = 1 \\] still indicating perfect visibility.\\n\\nStep 7: Since the choice of whether to insert or remove the beam splitter occurs after the photon has entered the interferometer, the result is consistent with the Copenhagen interpretation, where the measurement collapses the wavefunction into a definite state.\\n\\nFinal Conclusion: The predicted fringe visibility for the delayed-choice experiment is 1, indicating perfect interference when the beam splitter is present, regardless of the timing of the choice device."}
