{"derivation":"Step 1: Define the wavefunction \\( |\\psi_t\\rangle \\) for the photon in the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The initial state can be expressed as a superposition of paths: \\( |\\psi_0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|A\\rangle + |B\\rangle) \\), where \\( |A\\rangle \\) and \\( |B\\rangle \\) represent the paths through the two arms of the interferometer.\\n\\nStep 2: Apply the Hamiltonian to evolve the state. The Hamiltonian is given by \\( H = H_0 + H_{int} + H_{stoch} \\). The state equation is \\( d|\\psi_t\\rangle = \\Bigl(-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}H dt + \\sum_i (L_i - 1) dN_i(t)\\Bigr)|\\psi_t\\rangle \\).\\n\\nStep 3: Consider the stochastic collapses. The localisation operator for the photon is given by \\( L_i(r) = \\left(\\frac{\\pi \\sigma^2}{4}\\right)^{-3/4} \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(\\hat{r}_i - r)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right] \\). The mean collapse rate is \\( \\lambda = 1 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\) and the spatial width is \\( \\sigma = 1 \\times 10^{-7} \, \\text{m} \\).\\n\\nStep 4: Calculate the probability of localisation events. The expected number of localisation events in a time interval \\( dt \\) is given by \\( \\lambda dt \\). For a single photon, the probability of a localisation event occurring is \\( P_{localisation} = \\lambda dt \\).\\n\\nStep 5: After a localisation event, the Born rule applies. The probability of detecting the photon at a specific position is given by the square of the wavefunction's amplitude. The visibility of the interference pattern is defined as \\( V = \\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}} \\), where \\( I_{max} \\) and \\( I_{min} \\) are the maximum and minimum intensities of the interference pattern.\\n\\nStep 6: The intensity can be expressed in terms of the wavefunction as follows: \\( I = |\\psi|^2 \\). In the presence of localisation events, the visibility will be affected by the localisation width \\( \\sigma \\). The visibility can be approximated as \\( V(\\sigma) = V_0 e^{-\\frac{d^2}{\\sigma^2}} \\), where \\( d \\) is the distance between the two paths in the interferometer.\\n\\nStep 7: Substitute the values into the visibility equation. Assuming \\( V_0 = 1 \\) (ideal visibility without localisation), we can calculate the visibility as follows: \\( V = 1 \\cdot e^{-\\frac{d^2}{(1 \\times 10^{-7})^2}} \\).\\n\\nStep 8: Given that the distance between the paths is typically on the order of \\( d = 1 \\times 10^{-4} \, \\text{m} \\), we find \\( V = e^{-\\frac{(1 \\times 10^{-4})^2}{(1 \\times 10^{-7})^2}} = e^{-10000} \\).\\n\\nStep 9: Calculate the numerical value of the visibility. Since \\( e^{-10000} \\) is extremely small, we can approximate it as \\( V \\approx 0 \\). However, we must also consider the detection efficiency and background noise corrections. The effective visibility is given by \\( V_{effective} = V \\cdot (1 - \\text{background noise}) \\cdot \\text{detection efficiency} \\).\\n\\nStep 10: Substitute the values: \\( V_{effective} = 0 \\cdot (1 - 0.018) \\cdot 0.82 = 0 \\). Thus, the final predicted fringe visibility for the delayed choice experiment is approximately 0 due to the strong localisation effects.","value":0.0}
