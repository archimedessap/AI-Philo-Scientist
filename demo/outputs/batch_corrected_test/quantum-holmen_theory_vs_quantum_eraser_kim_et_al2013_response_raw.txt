{"derivation": "Step 1: In the quantum eraser experiment, we start with the polarization-entangled photon pairs. The wavefunction for the system can be expressed as \\( |\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|H_A H_B\\rangle + |V_A V_B\\rangle) \\), where \\( |H\\rangle \\) and \\( |V\\rangle \\) represent horizontal and vertical polarizations, respectively. \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) denote the two entangled photons. This state is prepared such that each photon can pass through a double-slit setup with orthogonal polarizations tagging the paths. \n\nStep 2: The presence of which-path information is determined by the polarization states. If we measure the polarization of photon B, we can determine the path taken by photon A. The visibility of the interference pattern, \\( V \\), is given by the formula: \\( V = \\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}} \\), where \\( I_{max} \\) and \\( I_{min} \\) are the maximum and minimum intensities of the interference pattern, respectively. \n\nStep 3: In our theory, the stochastic collapses occur at a rate \\( \\lambda \\) with a spatial width \\( \\sigma \\). The effective localization operator for each photon is given by: \\( L_i(r) = \\left(\\frac{\\pi \\sigma^2}{4}\\right)^{-3/4} \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(\\hat{r}_i - r)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right] \\). This operator localizes the wavefunction of the photon at a position \\( r \\) with a Gaussian profile. \n\nStep 4: The interference visibility is affected by the localization events. The average number of localization events for each photon in a time interval \\( dt \\) is given by \\( \\lambda dt \\). The probability of observing a localization event is influenced by the detection efficiency \\( \\eta = 0.75 \\) and background noise \\( b = 0.025 \\). The effective visibility can be expressed as: \\( V_{eff} = V_{max} \\cdot \\eta - b \\). \n\nStep 5: The maximum visibility \\( V_{max} \\) for a perfect interference pattern is 1. Therefore, we calculate the effective visibility as follows: \n\\[ V_{eff} = 1 \\cdot 0.75 - 0.025 = 0.725. \\] \n\nStep 6: Finally, we account for systematic bias and resolution smearing. The systematic bias is \\( -0.018 \\) and the resolution smearing is \\( 0.015 \\). The final fringe visibility is given by: \n\\[ V_{final} = V_{eff} + systematic bias + resolution smearing = 0.725 - 0.018 + 0.015 = 0.722. \\] \n\nThus, the predicted fringe visibility for the quantum eraser experiment is \\( V_{final} = 0.722 \\).","value": 0.722}
