{"derivation":"Step 1: The visibility of the interference fringes in a Mach–Zehnder interferometer can be expressed as \\( V = \\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}} \\), where \\( I_{max} \\) and \\( I_{min} \\) are the maximum and minimum intensities of the interference pattern. In the context of the GRW theory, we need to consider the effect of spontaneous localization on the wavefunction of the photons.\\n\\nStep 2: The wavefunction of a single photon can be described by a superposition of paths through the interferometer. The localization events (or 'hits') will affect this superposition. The probability of a localization event occurring is given by the Poisson process with rate \\( \\lambda \\). Thus, the probability of having \\( n \\) hits in a time interval \\( t \\) is given by \\( P(n, t) = \\frac{(\\lambda t)^n e^{-\\lambda t}}{n!} \\).\\n\\nStep 3: The localization width \\( \\sigma \\) determines how sharply the wavefunction collapses. The Gaussian width of the localization operator is given by \\( L_i = (\\pi \\sigma^2)^{-3/4} \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(\\hat{r}_i - r)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right] \\). This means that the localization will cause the wavefunction to collapse around a point with a spread determined by \\( \\sigma \\).\\n\\nStep 4: The average number of localization events during the time the photon is in the interferometer can be estimated as \\( \\langle n \\rangle = \\lambda t \\). The visibility will be affected by the number of hits, as more hits will lead to a more classical behavior of the photon, reducing the visibility.\\n\\nStep 5: The effective visibility can be modeled as \\( V_{eff} = V_{max} \\exp(-\\langle n \\rangle) \\), where \\( V_{max} \\) is the visibility without localization effects. Assuming \\( V_{max} = 1 \\) (perfect visibility), we have \\( V_{eff} = \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\).\\n\\nStep 6: The time \\( t \\) the photon spends in the interferometer can be estimated based on the path length and the speed of light. For a typical Mach–Zehnder setup, let's assume \\( t \\approx 10^{-9} \\) seconds.\\n\\nStep 7: Now we can calculate the effective visibility: \\( V_{eff} = \\exp(-\\lambda t) = \\exp(-1 \\times 10^{-16} \\times 10^{-9}) = \\exp(-1 \\times 10^{-25}) \\approx 1 - 1 \\times 10^{-25} \\).\\n\\nStep 8: Finally, we need to account for the experimental corrections provided in the setup: detection efficiency (0.82), background noise (0.018), and systematic bias (-0.022). The corrected visibility can be calculated as follows: \\( V_{corrected} = V_{eff} \\times (1 - \\text{background noise}) + \\text{systematic bias} \\).\\n\\nStep 9: Plugging in the values: \\( V_{corrected} = (1 - 1 \\times 10^{-25}) \\times (1 - 0.018) - 0.022 \\approx 0.82 - 0.022 = 0.798 \\).\\n\\nStep 10: Therefore, the predicted fringe visibility for the delayed choice experiment is approximately 0.798.","value":0.798}
