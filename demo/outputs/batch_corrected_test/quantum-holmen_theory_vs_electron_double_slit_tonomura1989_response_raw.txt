{"derivation": "Step 1: The fringe visibility (V) in an interference experiment is defined as V = (I_max - I_min) / (I_max + I_min), where I_max and I_min are the maximum and minimum intensities of the interference pattern, respectively. In our case, we will relate these intensities to the wavefunction and the localization events. \\n\\nStep 2: The wavefunction \\psi(x) for the electron can be expressed as a superposition of two paths (from the double slit) leading to interference. The intensity is proportional to the square of the wavefunction: I(x) \\propto |\\psi(x)|^2. \\n\\nStep 3: The localization events introduce stochastic collapses that affect the visibility. The mean collapse rate \\lambda = 1 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{s}^{-1} and the spatial width of localization \\sigma = 1 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{m} will influence the coherence of the wavefunction. \\n\\nStep 4: The localization operator L_i acts on the wavefunction, leading to a Gaussian localization: L_i(r) = \\left(\\pi \\sigma^2\\right)^{-3/4} \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(\\hat{r}_i - r)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right]. \\n\\nStep 5: The effective visibility can be approximated by considering the decay of coherence due to localization. The coherence length is given by the width of the localization kernel, which affects the interference pattern. The visibility can be expressed as V = e^{-\\frac{L}{\\sigma}} where L is the distance between the slits. \\n\\nStep 6: Assuming L = 0.1 \\text{m} (a typical slit separation), we calculate the visibility: V = e^{-\\frac{0.1}{1 \\times 10^{-7}}} = e^{-10^8}. This value is extremely small, indicating that the visibility is significantly reduced due to localization. \\n\\nStep 7: To include the detection efficiency and systematic bias, we adjust the visibility: V_{adjusted} = V \\times \\text{detection efficiency} + \\text{systematic bias} = e^{-10^8} \\times 0.92 - 0.02. \\n\\nStep 8: Since e^{-10^8} is practically zero, the adjusted visibility will be dominated by the systematic bias: V_{final} \\approx -0.02. This indicates that the interference pattern is nearly completely washed out due to the localization effects and the systematic bias."}
