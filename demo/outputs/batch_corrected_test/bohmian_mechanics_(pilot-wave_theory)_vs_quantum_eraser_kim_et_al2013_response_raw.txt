{"derivation": "Step 1: In the quantum eraser experiment, we start with the polarization-entangled photon pairs. The wavefunction \\( \\psi \\) of the system can be expressed as a superposition of states corresponding to the two paths (slits) taken by the photons. The initial state can be written as: \\( \\psi = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|H_1, V_2\\rangle + |V_1, H_2\\rangle) \\), where \\( |H\\rangle \\) and \\( |V\\rangle \\) denote horizontal and vertical polarizations, respectively. \n\nStep 2: The guiding equation for the trajectory of the particles is given by: \\( \\dot{\\mathbf{q}}_k = \\frac{\\hbar}{m_k} \\Im \\left( \\frac{\\nabla_k \\psi}{\\psi} \\right)_{\\mathbf{q}(t)} \\). This means that the velocity of each photon is determined by the gradient of the wavefunction's phase. \n\nStep 3: When which-path information is available (i.e., the polarization states are not erased), the interference pattern is destroyed, and the fringe visibility \\( V \\) is given by: \\( V = \\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}} \\), where \\( I_{max} \\) and \\( I_{min} \\) are the maximum and minimum intensities of the detected photons. \n\nStep 4: In the case of the quantum eraser, when the which-path information is erased, the interference is restored, leading to a visibility of \\( V = 1 \\) (perfect interference). However, due to the experimental conditions, we need to account for detection efficiency, background noise, and systematic biases. \n\nStep 5: The effective visibility can be calculated as follows: \\( V_{effective} = V \\cdot (1 - \\text{background noise}) \\cdot \\text{detection efficiency} + \\text{systematic bias} \\). Substituting the values: \\( V = 1 \\), detection efficiency = 0.75, background noise = 0.025, and systematic bias = -0.018. \n\nStep 6: Therefore, we calculate: \n\\[ V_{effective} = 1 \\cdot (1 - 0.025) \\cdot 0.75 - 0.018 \\] \n\\[ V_{effective} = 1 \\cdot 0.975 \\cdot 0.75 - 0.018 \\] \n\\[ V_{effective} = 0.73125 - 0.018 \\] \n\\[ V_{effective} = 0.71325 \\]. \n\nStep 7: The final predicted value for fringe visibility in this quantum eraser experiment is approximately \\( 0.71325 \\).","value": 0.71325}
