{"derivation": "Step 1: In Bohmian Mechanics, the trajectory of a single photon is determined by the guiding equation. The wavefunction \\( \\psi \\) evolves according to the Schrödinger equation: \\[ i\\hbar\\,\\partial_t\\,\\psi = H_{QM}\\,\\psi \\] where \\( H_{QM} \\) is the Hamiltonian of the system. For a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, the Hamiltonian can be simplified to account for the two paths the photon can take. \\n \\n Step 2: The guiding equation gives the velocity of the photon as: \\[ \\dot{\\mathbf q}_k = \\frac{\\hbar}{m_k}\\,\\Im\\left(\\frac{\\nabla_k \\psi}{\\psi}\\right)_{\\mathbf q(t)} \\] where \\( \\mathbf{q}_k \\) is the position of the photon. The wavefunction \\( \\psi \\) will have contributions from both paths in the interferometer. \\n \\n Step 3: The interference pattern (fringe visibility) is determined by the relative phase difference between the two paths. If the output beam splitter is present, the wavefunction can be expressed as: \\[ \\psi = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\psi_1 + \\psi_2) \\] where \\( \\psi_1 \\) and \\( \\psi_2 \\) are the wavefunctions corresponding to the two paths. The visibility \\( V \\) of the interference fringes is given by: \\[ V = \\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}} \\] where \\( I_{max} \\) and \\( I_{min} \\) are the maximum and minimum intensities of the interference pattern. \\n \\n Step 4: The intensity is proportional to the square of the wavefunction's amplitude: \\[ I = |\\psi|^2 \\] Therefore, we can express the intensities as: \\[ I_{max} = |\\psi|^2_{max} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad I_{min} = |\\psi|^2_{min} \\] The maximum intensity occurs when the two paths are in phase, and the minimum intensity occurs when they are out of phase. \\n \\n Step 5: The phase difference \\( \\Delta \\phi \\) between the two paths can be controlled by the electro-optic modulator. If we denote the phase difference as \\( \\Delta \\phi = \\phi_1 - \\phi_2 \\), then we can express the visibility as a function of this phase difference: \\[ V(\\Delta \\phi) = \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\phi}{2}\\right) \\] \\n \\n Step 6: In the delayed-choice experiment, the decision to insert or remove the output beam splitter is made after the photon has entered the interferometer. This means that the wavefunction will still evolve according to the Schrödinger equation regardless of the choice made. The effective decoherence leads to an apparent collapse of the wavefunction, but the underlying Bohmian trajectory remains deterministic. \\n \\n Step 7: Given the experimental parameters, we can calculate the expected fringe visibility. The detection efficiency is given as 0.82, and we need to account for background noise and systematic bias. The effective visibility can be calculated as: \\[ V_{effective} = V \\times (1 - \\text{background noise}) + \\text{systematic bias} \\] \\n \\n Step 8: Assuming ideal visibility \\( V = 1 \\) (perfect interference), we have: \\[ V_{effective} = 1 \\times (1 - 0.018) - 0.022 = 0.982 - 0.022 = 0.960 \\] \\n \\n Step 9: Finally, we apply the calibration uncertainty to refine our result. The calibration uncertainty for detection efficiency is \\( \\sigma_{detection} = 0.038 \\), and we can incorporate this into our final value. The final predicted fringe visibility is: \\[ V_{final} = V_{effective} - \\sigma_{detection} = 0.960 - 0.038 = 0.922 \\] Thus, the predicted fringe visibility for the delayed-choice experiment is approximately 0.922."}
