{"derivation": "Step 1: The experiment involves electron interference, which is described by the wavefunction ψ(x) of the electron. The wavefunction evolves unitarily according to the Schrödinger equation: iħ∂ₜψ = H_QMψ, where H_QM is the Hamiltonian. For a free electron (after passing through the biprism), H_QM ≈ p²/(2m). The solution is a plane wave ψ(x) ∝ exp(ikx), where k = p/ħ is the wavevector. Step 2: The biprism acts as a double-slit analog, creating two coherent sources. The wavefunction at the screen is the superposition ψ(x) = ψ₁(x) + ψ₂(x), where ψ₁ and ψ₂ are wavefunctions from each 'slit'. The intensity pattern is I(x) = |ψ₁ + ψ₂|² = |ψ₁|² + |ψ₂|² + 2Re(ψ₁*ψ₂). The interference term 2Re(ψ₁*ψ₂) gives the fringes. Step 3: For a biprism, the fringe visibility V is given by V = (I_max - I_min)/(I_max + I_min). For ideal coherent sources, V = 1. Step 4: The detection efficiency (0.92) and background noise (0.01) reduce the visibility. The corrected visibility is V_corrected = V_ideal × detection_efficiency × (1 - background_noise) = 1 × 0.92 × 0.99 ≈ 0.9108. Step 5: The systematic bias (-0.02) further adjusts the visibility: V_final = V_corrected + systematic_bias ≈ 0.9108 - 0.02 ≈ 0.8908. Step 6: Resolution smearing (0.005) slightly blurs the fringes, reducing visibility: V_final ≈ 0.8908 - 0.005 ≈ 0.8858."}
