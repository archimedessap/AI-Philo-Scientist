To analyze the given experiment using Bohmian Mechanics, we will follow the principles and formalism of the theory to derive the predicted CHSH S value for the entangled photon pairs. 

### Step-by-Step Derivation

**Step 1: Understanding the Setup**
In the experiment, we have polarization-entangled photon pairs emitted from a calcium atom cascade. The photons are detected after passing through polarizers set at angles \(0^\circ\), \(22.5^\circ\), \(45^\circ\), and \(67.5^\circ\). The CHSH inequality involves measuring correlations between the outcomes of two measurements on two separate entangled particles.

**Step 2: Define the Wavefunction**
The state of the polarization-entangled photon pairs can be represented by the Bell state:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |H\rangle_A |V\rangle_B - |V\rangle_A |H\rangle_B \right)
\]
where \( |H\rangle \) and \( |V\rangle \) represent horizontal and vertical polarization states, respectively.

**Step 3: Measurement Outcomes**
For each photon, the outcomes can be represented as \( A(a) \) and \( B(b) \), where \( A \) and \( B \) are the measurement results of the two detectors, and \( a \) and \( b \) are the angles of the polarizers. The possible outcomes for each measurement are \( +1 \) or \( -1 \).

**Step 4: Correlation Function**
The correlation function \( E(a, b) \) is defined as:
\[
E(a, b) = P(A(a) = B(b)) - P(A(a) \neq B(b))
\]
For the entangled state, we can compute the correlation based on the angles of the polarizers:
\[
E(a, b) = \cos(2(a - b))
\]

**Step 5: CHSH S Value Calculation**
The CHSH S value is defined as:
\[
S = E(a_1, b_1) + E(a_1, b_2) + E(a_2, b_1) - E(a_2, b_2)
\]
Choosing the angles:
- \( a_1 = 0^\circ \)
- \( a_2 = 45^\circ \)
- \( b_1 = 22.5^\circ \)
- \( b_2 = 67.5^\circ \)

We compute each term:
1. \( E(0^\circ, 22.5^\circ) = \cos(2(0 - 22.5)) = \cos(-45) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \)
2. \( E(0^\circ, 67.5^\circ) = \cos(2(0 - 67.5)) = \cos(-135) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \)
3. \( E(45^\circ, 22.5^\circ) = \cos(2(45 - 22.5)) = \cos(45) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \)
4. \( E(45^\circ, 67.5^\circ) = \cos(2(45 - 67.5)) = \cos(-45) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \)

Now substituting these values into the CHSH S value formula:
\[
S = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2\sqrt{2}
\]

**Step 6: Correcting for Instrumental Factors**
Given the experimental setup includes detection efficiency, background noise, and systematic bias, we need to adjust our theoretical prediction. The effective detection efficiency is \( \eta = 0.85 \) and the systematic bias is \( -0.015 \).

The corrected S value can be approximated as:
\[
S_{\text{corrected}} = S + \text{systematic bias} = 2\sqrt{2} - 0.015
\]

Calculating \( 2\sqrt{2} \):
\[
2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.828
\]
Thus,
\[
S_{\text{corrected}} \approx 2.828 - 0.015 = 2.813
\]
