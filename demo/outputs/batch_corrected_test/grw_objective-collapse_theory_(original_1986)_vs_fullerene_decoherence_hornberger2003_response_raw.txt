{"derivation": "Step 1: The visibility of interference fringes in a quantum mechanical experiment can be expressed as \\( V = \\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}} \\), where \\( I_{max} \\) and \\( I_{min} \\) are the maximum and minimum intensities of the interference pattern, respectively. In the presence of decoherence, the visibility is reduced due to the interaction of the particle with the environment. \\n\\nStep 2: The decoherence factor can be modeled using the GRW theory, where the localization width \\( \\sigma \\) and the mean collapse rate \\( \\lambda \\) play crucial roles. The decoherence time \\( t_d \\) can be estimated as \\( t_d \\approx \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\lambda} \\). Substituting the values, we have: \\( \\sigma = 1 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m} \\) and \\( \\lambda = 1 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ s}^{-1} \\). \\n\\nStep 3: Calculate the decoherence time: \\[ t_d \\approx \\frac{(1 \\times 10^{-7})^2}{1 \\times 10^{-16}} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-14}}{1 \\times 10^{-16}} = 100 \\text{ s} \\] \\n\\nStep 4: The visibility can be expressed as a function of the decoherence time. For a particle in a Talbot-Lau interferometer, the visibility is given by: \\[ V = e^{-t/t_d} \\] where \\( t \\) is the time of flight of the particle through the interferometer. The average velocity of the C70 fullerene is given as 100 m/s, and the distance between the gratings in the interferometer can be approximated as the grating period, which is 990 nm or \\( 9.9 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m} \\). The time of flight is then: \\[ t = \\frac{d}{v} = \\frac{9.9 \\times 10^{-7}}{100} = 9.9 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ s} \\] \\n\\nStep 5: Now substituting the time of flight into the visibility equation: \\[ V = e^{-\\frac{9.9 \\times 10^{-9}}{100}} \\approx e^{-9.9 \\times 10^{-11}} \\approx 1 - 9.9 \\times 10^{-11} \\] (using the approximation \\( e^{-x} \\approx 1 - x \\) for small \\( x \\)). \\n\\nStep 6: The observed visibility is affected by the detection efficiency and other instrumental corrections. The effective visibility can be calculated as: \\[ V_{eff} = V \\times \\text{detection efficiency} - \\text{background noise} + \\text{systematic bias} \\] Substituting the values: \\[ V_{eff} = (1 - 9.9 \\times 10^{-11}) \\times 0.88 - 0.015 - 0.025 \\] \\[ V_{eff} \\approx 0.88 - 0.015 - 0.025 = 0.84 \\] \\n\\nStep 7: Finally, we account for the resolution smearing, which reduces the effective visibility further. The final visibility is given by: \\[ V_{final} = V_{eff} - \\text{resolution smearing} \\] \\[ V_{final} = 0.84 - 0.012 = 0.828 \\] Thus, the predicted fringe visibility for the experiment is approximately 0.828."}
