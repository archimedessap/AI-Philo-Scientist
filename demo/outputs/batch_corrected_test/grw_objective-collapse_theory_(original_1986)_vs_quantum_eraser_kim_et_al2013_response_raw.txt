{"derivation": "Step 1: The fringe visibility (V) in a quantum eraser experiment can be expressed in terms of the probabilities of detecting the photons in the interference pattern. In the presence of which-path information, the visibility is given by V = (P_{max} - P_{min}) / (P_{max} + P_{min}), where P_{max} and P_{min} are the maximum and minimum probabilities of detection, respectively. \\n\\nStep 2: In the GRW theory, the localization of the wavefunction due to spontaneous collapses affects the probabilities. The localization width \\sigma determines how sharply the wavefunction collapses, and the mean collapse rate \\lambda indicates how frequently these collapses occur. \\n\\nStep 3: The probability of detecting a photon at a specific position can be modeled using the Gaussian localization operator: L_i = \\left(\\pi \\sigma^2\\right)^{-3/4} \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(\\hat{r}_i - r)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right]. The effective probability distribution for detecting the photon will be influenced by the number of collapses that occur before detection. \\n\\nStep 4: The effective probability of detecting a photon in the interference pattern can be approximated as: P_{interference} = \\int L_i \\cdot P_{quantum} \\, dr, where P_{quantum} is the quantum mechanical probability distribution without collapses. \\n\\nStep 5: The interference pattern visibility can be affected by the ratio of the collapse rate to the coherence time of the photons. If we denote the coherence time as T_c, we can express the visibility as: V = V_{max} \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda T_c}{2}\\right), where V_{max} is the maximum visibility without collapses. \\n\\nStep 6: The coherence time T_c can be estimated based on the experimental setup and the properties of the entangled photon pairs. For polarization-entangled photons, T_c is typically on the order of picoseconds. Assuming T_c \\approx 10^{-12} s, we can substitute the values: \\lambda = 1 \\times 10^{-16} s^{-1}. \\n\\nStep 7: Calculate the exponential term: \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1 \\times 10^{-16} \\cdot 10^{-12}}{2}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-5 \\times 10^{-29}\\right) \\approx 1. \\n\\nStep 8: Therefore, the visibility remains approximately V \\approx V_{max}. In the absence of any other factors, we can assume V_{max} to be 1 (100% visibility) under ideal conditions. However, we must account for the experimental corrections: \\text{V}_{corrected} = V \\cdot (1 - \\text{detection efficiency}) \\cdot (1 - \\text{background noise}) + \\text{systematic bias}. \\n\\nStep 9: Substituting the values: \\text{V}_{corrected} = 1 \\cdot (1 - 0.75) \\cdot (1 - 0.025) - 0.018 = 0.25 \\cdot 0.975 - 0.018 = 0.24375 - 0.018 = 0.22575. \\n\\nStep 10: Therefore, the final predicted value for fringe visibility in this quantum eraser experiment is approximately 0.22575."}
