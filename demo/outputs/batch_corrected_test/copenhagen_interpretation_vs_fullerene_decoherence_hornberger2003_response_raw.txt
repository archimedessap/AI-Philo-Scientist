{"derivation": "Step 1: Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of the C70 fullerene. The de Broglie wavelength is given by \\lambda_{dB} = \\frac{h}{p}, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the particle. For a particle with mass m and velocity v, p = m v. Here, m = 840 amu = 840 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg and v = 100 m/s. Thus, \\lambda_{dB} = \\frac{6.62607015e-34}{840 * 1.66053906660e-27 * 100} = 4.75e-12 m. Step 2: Calculate the Talbot length for the interferometer. The Talbot length L_T is given by L_T = \\frac{d^2}{\\lambda_{dB}}, where d is the grating period (990 nm). Thus, L_T = \\frac{(990e-9)^2}{4.75e-12} = 0.206 m. Step 3: Estimate the decoherence due to thermal radiation. The decoherence rate \\Gamma for a particle in a thermal environment is given by \\Gamma = \\frac{\\Lambda k_B T}{\\hbar}, where \\Lambda is the localization parameter, k_B is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. For a spherical particle, \\Lambda \\approx \\frac{m^2 a^2}{\\hbar^2}, where a is the radius of the particle. For C70, a \\approx 0.5 nm. Thus, \\Lambda \\approx \\frac{(840 * 1.66053906660e-27)^2 (0.5e-9)^2}{(1.054571817e-34)^2} = 4.43e+23 m^{-2} s^{-1}. The decoherence rate is then \\Gamma = \\frac{4.43e+23 * 1.380649e-23 * 900}{1.054571817e-34} = 5.21e+34 s^{-1}. Step 4: Calculate the fringe visibility. The fringe visibility V is given by V = V_0 e^{-\\Gamma t}, where V_0 is the initial visibility (assumed to be 1 for perfect coherence) and t is the time between gratings. For a Talbot-Lau interferometer, t \\approx \\frac{L_T}{v} = \\frac{0.206}{100} = 2.06e-3 s. Thus, V = e^{-5.21e+34 * 2.06e-3} \\approx 0, as the decoherence is extremely rapid. Step 5: Apply instrument corrections. The observed visibility is corrected for detection efficiency (0.88), background noise (0.015), systematic bias (-0.025), and resolution smearing (0.012). The corrected visibility V_{corr} = V * detection_efficiency + background_noise + systematic_bias - resolution_smearing = 0 * 0.88 + 0.015 - 0.025 - 0.012 = -0.022. However, visibility cannot be negative, so we take V_{corr} = 0."}
