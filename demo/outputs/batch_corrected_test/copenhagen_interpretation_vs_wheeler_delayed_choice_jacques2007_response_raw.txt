{"derivation": "Step 1: Define the initial state of the single photon entering the Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) as |ψ⟩ = |1⟩, where |1⟩ represents the photon in the input port. The MZI consists of two beam splitters (BS1 and BS2) and mirrors. The first beam splitter (BS1) transforms the state as: |1⟩ → (|a⟩ + i|b⟩)/√2, where |a⟩ and |b⟩ are the two paths in the interferometer. Step 2: The quantum random number generator (RNG) determines whether the second beam splitter (BS2) is inserted or removed after the photon has entered the MZI. If BS2 is inserted, the state evolves as: (|a⟩ + i|b⟩)/√2 → (i|a⟩ + |b⟩)/√2 (after reflection at BS2). The output ports then interfere, yielding |ψ_final⟩ = (i|a⟩ + |b⟩)/√2. The probability of detecting the photon at either output port is |⟨a|ψ_final⟩|² = |⟨b|ψ_final⟩|² = 0.5, resulting in no interference fringes (visibility = 0). If BS2 is removed, the paths |a⟩ and |b⟩ do not interfere, and the photon is detected in one of the two output ports with equal probability (visibility = 0). Step 3: The fringe visibility V is defined as V = (I_max - I_min)/(I_max + I_min), where I_max and I_min are the maximum and minimum intensities of the interference pattern. For this experiment, since the choice is made after the photon enters the MZI, the Copenhagen interpretation predicts that the photon behaves as a wave or particle depending on the delayed choice. However, in both cases (BS2 inserted or removed), the visibility V = 0 because the probabilities are equal for both outcomes. Step 4: The detection efficiency (0.82) and other instrument corrections do not affect the theoretical prediction of fringe visibility but would be used to compare with experimental results. The Copenhagen interpretation does not introduce any additional parameters to modify the visibility prediction."}
