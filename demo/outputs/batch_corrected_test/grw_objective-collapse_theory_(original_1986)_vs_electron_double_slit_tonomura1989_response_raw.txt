{"derivation":"Step 1: The fringe visibility (V) in an interference experiment can be expressed as V = \\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}}, where I_{max} and I_{min} are the maximum and minimum intensities of the interference pattern, respectively.\\n\\nStep 2: In the context of GRW theory, the localization of the wavefunction due to spontaneous collapses affects the interference pattern. The localization width \\sigma determines how sharply the wavefunction collapses, which in turn affects the visibility of the fringes.\\n\\nStep 3: The visibility can be modified by the localization width. The effective visibility can be approximated as V_{eff} = V_{ideal} e^{-\\frac{d^2}{2\\sigma^2}}, where d is the distance between the slits. For a double-slit experiment, the ideal visibility V_{ideal} is 1 (perfect interference).\\n\\nStep 4: The localization width \\sigma is given as 1 \\times 10^{-7} m. We need to determine the distance d between the slits. For a typical double-slit setup, let's assume d = 0.1 mm = 1 \\times 10^{-4} m.\\n\\nStep 5: Calculate the effective visibility: V_{eff} = 1 \\cdot e^{-\\frac{(1 \\times 10^{-4})^2}{2(1 \\times 10^{-7})^2}} = e^{-\\frac{1 \\times 10^{-8}}{2 \\times 10^{-14}}} = e^{5 \\times 10^{6}}.\\n\\nStep 6: Since this value is extremely large, it indicates that the effective visibility approaches 0, meaning the interference pattern is completely washed out due to the localization effects.\\n\\nStep 7: However, we must also consider the experimental corrections: detection efficiency (0.92), background noise (0.01), and systematic bias (-0.02). The corrected visibility can be calculated as V_{corrected} = V_{eff} \\cdot (1 - background\_noise + detection\_efficiency + systematic\_bias).\\n\\nStep 8: Plugging in the values: V_{corrected} = 0 \\cdot (1 - 0.01 + 0.92 - 0.02) = 0.\\n\\nStep 9: Therefore, the final predicted fringe visibility is 0, indicating no observable interference pattern due to the effects of spontaneous localization in the GRW framework.","value":0.0}
