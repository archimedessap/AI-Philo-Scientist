{"derivation": "Step 1: Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of the molecule. Using λ = h / (m * v), where h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), m is the mass (720 u = 720 * 1.66e-27 kg), and v is the velocity (200 m/s). Step 2: Compute the fringe spacing Δy using the double-slit formula Δy = (λ * L) / d, where L is the screen distance (75 cm = 0.75 m) and d is the slit separation (0.25 μm = 0.25e-6 m). Step 3: Incorporate the Quantum-Holmen Theory correction. The modified Hamiltonian introduces a decoherence term η · exp[-(r/Λ)^2], which reduces fringe visibility. The expected visibility is V = exp[-η * (d/Λ)^2], where d is the slit separation and Λ is the characteristic length scale (2e-6 m). Step 4: Plug in the values for η (0.00032), d (0.25e-6 m), and Λ (2e-6 m) to compute V."}
