{"derivation": "Step 1: Define the initial state of the fullerene molecule in the Talbot–Lau interferometer as a coherent superposition of paths, represented by the wavefunction \\( \\psi \\). The interference pattern arises from the coherent overlap of these paths, producing fringes with visibility \\( V_0 \\) (ideal visibility without decoherence). \n\nStep 2: According to the Copenhagen interpretation, the system evolves unitarily under the Hamiltonian \n\\[ H_{QM} = \\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2m} + V(\\hat{r}) \\]\nwhere \\( m = 840 \\text{ amu} \\approx 1.39 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg} \\), and \\( V(\\hat{r}) \\) represents the grating potential. The time evolution is given by the Schrödinger equation:\n\\[ i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\psi = H_{QM} \\psi \\]\n\nStep 3: In the absence of environmental interactions, the wavefunction remains coherent, and the fringe visibility \\( V_0 \\) is maximal (close to 1, limited by instrumental factors).\n\nStep 4: Decoherence due to environmental scattering (residual gas, blackbody photons) causes partial loss of coherence. In the Copenhagen interpretation, decoherence is not a physical process but is described effectively as a reduction in the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix due to entanglement with environment (though fundamentally, the wavefunction remains pure until measurement).\n\nStep 5: The measured fringe visibility \\( V \\) corresponds to the magnitude of the coherence terms in the density matrix after environmental interaction but before measurement. The visibility is given by:\n\\[ V = V_0 \\times \\gamma \\]\nwhere \\( \\gamma \\) is the decoherence factor (\\( 0 \\leq \\gamma \\leq 1 \\)) representing the reduction of coherence.\n\nStep 6: In the Copenhagen interpretation, the decoherence factor \\( \\gamma \\) is not derived from a modified dynamics but understood phenomenologically as the loss of observable interference contrast due to environmental entanglement and subsequent measurement collapse.\n\nStep 7: The experimental parameters are:\n- Particle mass: \\( m = 840 \\text{ amu} \\)\n- Velocity: \\( v = 100 \\text{ m/s} \\)\n- Grating period: \\( d = 990 \\text{ nm} = 9.9 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m} \\)\n- Environment: high vacuum, thermal source at 900 K\n\nStep 8: The time of flight through the interferometer of length \\( L \\) (assumed from setup, typical Talbot–Lau length \\( L \\approx 0.5 \\text{ m} \\)) is:\n\\[ t = \\frac{L}{v} = \\frac{0.5}{100} = 5 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ s} \\]\n\nStep 9: The decoherence factor \\( \\gamma \\) can be estimated from the probability of scattering events during \\( t \\). Given the high vacuum, scattering is rare, so \\( \\gamma \\approx 1 - P_{scattering} \\), with \\( P_{scattering} \\ll 1 \\).\n\nStep 10: Instrumental corrections reduce the observed visibility. The corrected visibility is:\n\\[ V_{obs} = V \\times \\eta - B + S \\]\nwhere\n- \\( \\eta = 0.88 \\) (detection efficiency)\n- \\( B = 0.015 \\) (background noise)\n- \\( S = -0.025 \\) (systematic bias)\n\nStep 11: Assuming ideal initial visibility \\( V_0 = 1 \\) and negligible decoherence \\( \\gamma \\approx 1 \\), the predicted visibility is:\n\\[ V_{pred} = V_0 \\times \\gamma = 1 \\times 1 = 1 \\]\n\nStep 12: Applying instrumental corrections:\n\\[ V_{corrected} = V_{pred} \\times 0.88 - 0.015 - 0.025 = 0.88 - 0.04 = 0.84 \\]\n\nStep 13: Accounting for resolution smearing (\\( 0.012 \\)) reduces visibility further:\n\\[ V_{final} = V_{corrected} - 0.012 = 0.828 \\]\n\nStep 14: Thus, the predicted fringe visibility under the Copenhagen interpretation, given the experimental parameters and corrections, is approximately \\( 0.83 \\).\n\nStep 15: Physically, this means the wavefunction remains coherent during propagation, and the observed reduction in visibility is attributed to instrumental imperfections and environmental scattering treated phenomenologically, with the fundamental collapse occurring only upon measurement."}
