{"derivation": "Step 1: Define the initial state of the single photon entering the Machâ€“Zehnder interferometer (MZI). The photon is prepared in a spatial mode \\( |\\psi_0\\rangle \\). After the first beam splitter (BS1), the state evolves unitarily to a superposition of two paths: \\[ |\\psi_1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\text{path } A\\rangle + |\\text{path } B\\rangle) \\] where \\(|\\text{path } A\\rangle\\) and \\(|\\text{path } B\\rangle\\) represent the photon traveling along the two arms of the interferometer. \n\nStep 2: The photon propagates through the interferometer arms, accumulating a relative phase \\( \\phi \\) due to path length differences or phase shifters: \n\\[ |\\psi_2\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\text{path } A\\rangle + e^{i\\phi} |\\text{path } B\\rangle) \\]\n\nStep 3: The delayed choice is implemented by the electro-optic modulator (EOM) that inserts or removes the output beam splitter (BS2) after the photon has entered the interferometer. This choice is made by a quantum random number generator (QRNG), ensuring the choice is space-like separated from the photon's entry.\n\nStep 4: According to the Copenhagen interpretation, the wavefunction \\( \\psi \\) evolves unitarily until measurement. The presence or absence of BS2 changes the measurement basis:\n- If BS2 is inserted (closed interferometer), the measurement projects onto the superposition basis, enabling interference.\n- If BS2 is removed (open interferometer), the measurement projects onto the path basis, destroying interference.\n\nStep 5: Formalize the measurement projectors:\n- With BS2 (interference measurement):\n\\[ \\Pi_{\\pm} = |\\pm\\rangle\\langle \\pm|, \\quad |\\pm\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\text{path } A\\rangle \\pm |\\text{path } B\\rangle) \\]\n- Without BS2 (which-path measurement):\n\\[ \\Pi_A = |\\text{path } A\\rangle\\langle \\text{path } A|, \\quad \\Pi_B = |\\text{path } B\\rangle\\langle \\text{path } B| \\]\n\nStep 6: Calculate the detection probabilities for the two cases.\n\nCase 1: BS2 inserted (closed interferometer)\n\\[ P_{+} = |\\langle + | \\psi_2 \\rangle|^2 = \\left| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + e^{i\\phi} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (1 + \\cos \\phi) \\]\n\\[ P_{-} = 1 - P_{+} = \\frac{1}{2} (1 - \\cos \\phi) \\]\n\nThe interference fringe visibility \\( V \\) is defined as:\n\\[ V = \\frac{P_{\\max} - P_{\\min}}{P_{\\max} + P_{\\min}} = \\frac{(1 + 1) / 2 - (1 - 1) / 2}{(1 + 1) / 2 + (1 - 1) / 2} = 1 \\]\n\nCase 2: BS2 removed (open interferometer)\n\\[ P_A = |\\langle \\text{path } A | \\psi_2 \\rangle|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\\[ P_B = |\\langle \\text{path } B | \\psi_2 \\rangle|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nNo dependence on \\( \\phi \\), so no interference fringes, and visibility is:\n\\[ V = 0 \\]\n\nStep 7: Since the choice is made after the photon enters the interferometer, the Copenhagen interpretation treats the wavefunction as evolving unitarily until measurement, where the projective collapse occurs. The measurement basis depends on the delayed choice, which retroactively determines whether interference is observed.\n\nStep 8: Incorporate instrument corrections. The measured fringe visibility \\( V_{meas} \\) is affected by detection efficiency \\( \\eta = 0.93 \\), background noise \\( b = 0.008 \\), systematic bias \\( s = 0.002 \\), and resolution smearing \\( r = 0.008 \\). These reduce the ideal visibility:\n\nAssuming linear degradation,\n\\[ V_{corrected} = V_{ideal} \\times \\eta - b - s - r \\]\n\nFor the closed interferometer (ideal \\( V=1 \\)):\n\\[ V_{corrected} = 1 \\times 0.93 - 0.008 - 0.002 - 0.008 = 0.912 \\]\n\nStep 9: The final predicted fringe visibility for the delayed choice experiment under the Copenhagen interpretation is therefore approximately \\( 0.91 \\), reflecting high visibility when BS2 is inserted and zero otherwise. The delayed choice does not alter the fundamental unitary evolution but changes the measurement projector, consistent with the interpretation's ontology and measurement postulate."}
