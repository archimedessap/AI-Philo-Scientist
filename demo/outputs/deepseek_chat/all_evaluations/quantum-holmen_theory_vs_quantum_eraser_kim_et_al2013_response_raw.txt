Here is the analysis of the quantum eraser experiment using Quantum-Holmen Theory:

{"derivation": "Step 1: The experiment uses polarization-entangled photon pairs with orthogonal polarizations tagging each slit. The initial state is |\\psi_0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|L\\rangle_1|H\\rangle_2 + |R\\rangle_1|V\\rangle_2), where L/R denote slit positions and H/V denote horizontal/vertical polarizations. Step 2: The stochastic collapse field acts on both photons. For photon 1 (double-slit photon), the collapse operator L_1(r) = (\\pi\\sigma^2)^{-3/4}e^{-(\\hat{r}_1-r)^2/(2\\sigma^2)} localizes its position with rate \\lambda. Step 3: Between collapses, the Bohmian guidance equation \\dot{r}_1 = (\\hbar/m)Im(\\nabla_1\\psi/\\psi) determines the trajectory. The which-path information is encoded in the polarization entanglement. Step 4: When the eraser measures photon 2's polarization in the diagonal basis (delayed choice), the effective collapse rate for the system becomes \\lambda_{eff} = 2\\lambda (for two particles). The visibility V = e^{-\\lambda_{eff}t(1-e^{-d^2/(4\\sigma^2)})}, where d is slit separation. Step 5: Using \\lambda = 10^{-16}s^{-1}, \\sigma = 10^{-7}m, t = 1ns (typical photon flight time), d = 1mm: V = exp[-2*10^{-16}*10^{-9}(1-exp(-10^{-6}/(4*10^{-14})))] = exp[-2*10^{-25}] \\approx 1. Step 6: Without eraser, the which-path information remains and V=0 due to orthogonal polarizations marking the slits."}
{"value": 1.00}

The derivation shows that:
1) The collapse rate is too small (\\lambda=10^{-16}s^{-1}) to significantly affect the photons during their brief flight time
2) The eraser measurement restores full interference visibility by erasing which-path information
3) Without erasure, the orthogonal polarizations completely destroy interference
4) The result matches standard quantum mechanics because \\lambda is so small that collapse effects are negligible at this scale

The numerical value 1.00 indicates perfect fringe visibility when the which-path information is erased, as predicted by both standard QM and Quantum-Holmen Theory (since its collapse parameters are too weak to affect this experiment).
