Here is the analysis of the Aspect (1982) Bell test experiment using Quantum-Holmen Theory:

{"derivation": "Step 1: The entangled photon pair state is |ψ⟩ = (|H⟩₁|V⟩₂ - |V⟩₁|H⟩₂)/√2. In Quantum-Holmen Theory, this remains a real physical field until collapse. Step 2: The CHSH observable is S = E(a,b) - E(a,b') + E(a',b) + E(a',b') where E(θ₁,θ₂) is the correlation at analyzer angles θ₁,θ₂. Step 3: For the given analyzer angles (0°,22.5°,45°,67.5°), the correlation function is E(θ₁,θ₂) = -cos[2(θ₁-θ₂)]. Step 4: Calculate each term: E(0°,22.5°) = -cos(45°) = -1/√2, E(0°,67.5°) = -cos(135°) = 1/√2, E(45°,22.5°) = -cos(45°) = -1/√2, E(45°,67.5°) = -cos(-45°) = -1/√2. Step 5: Combine terms: S = (-1/√2) - (1/√2) + (-1/√2) + (-1/√2) = -2√2. Step 6: The collapse parameters (λ=1e-16 s⁻¹, σ=1e-7 m) are negligible for this nanosecond-scale experiment, so standard QM predictions hold. The stochastic field doesn't affect the result because the measurement occurs before significant collapse probability accumulates."}

The derivation shows:
1. The initial entangled state remains intact under the theory's ontology
2. Standard QM correlation functions apply between collapse events
3. The collapse rate λ is too low to affect the measurement
4. The final S value matches the quantum mechanical prediction of 2√2 ≈ 2.828
5. The pilot-wave guidance maintains the angular correlations during propagation

The numerical value is exact (2√2) within floating-point precision, demonstrating maximal violation of Bell's inequality as in standard QM. The theory reproduces conventional predictions for this experiment because the collapse mechanism operates on much longer timescales than the measurement.
