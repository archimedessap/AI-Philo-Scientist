{"derivation": "Step 1: Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of the C70 fullerene. The de Broglie wavelength is given by \\[\\lambda_{dB} = \\frac{h}{p} = \\frac{h}{m v}\\] where \\(h\\) is Planck's constant, \\(m\\) is the mass of the C70 molecule (840 amu = 840 × 1.66 × 10^{-27} kg), and \\(v\\) is the velocity (100 m/s). Substituting the values: \\[\\lambda_{dB} = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34}}{840 \\times 1.66 \\times 10^{-27} \\times 100} \\approx 4.75 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{m}\\] Step 2: Determine the Talbot length for the interferometer. The Talbot length \\(L_T\\) for a grating period \\(d\\) (990 nm) is given by \\[L_T = \\frac{d^2}{\\lambda_{dB}}\\] Substituting the values: \\[L_T = \\frac{(990 \\times 10^{-9})^2}{4.75 \\times 10^{-12}} \\approx 0.206 \\text{m}\\] Step 3: Estimate the decoherence effects due to thermal radiation. The decoherence rate \\(\\Gamma\\) for a particle of mass \\(m\\) in a thermal environment at temperature \\(T\\) (900 K) is given by \\[\\Gamma = \\frac{8 \\pi^2 k_B^5 T^5 \\alpha}{3 \\hbar^4 c^4}\\] where \\(k_B\\) is Boltzmann's constant, \\(c\\) is the speed of light, and \\(\\alpha\\) is the polarizability of C70 (approximately \\(10^{-39} \\text{F m}^2\\)). However, this is a complex calculation, and for simplicity, we use the empirical observation that fringe visibility \\(V\\) in such experiments typically follows \\[V \\approx \\exp(-\\Gamma t)\\] where \\(t\\) is the interaction time. Given the high vacuum and thermal source, we estimate \\(V \\approx 0.5\\) based on experimental trends for similar setups."}
