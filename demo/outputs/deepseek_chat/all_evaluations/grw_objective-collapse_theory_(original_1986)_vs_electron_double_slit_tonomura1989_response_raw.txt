Here is the analysis of the experiment using GRW theory:

{"derivation": "Step 1: Calculate electron wavelength (λ_e) using de Broglie relation: λ_e = h/p, where p = √(2m_eE_k). For 50kV acceleration voltage, E_k = 50keV = 8.01e-15 J. Thus p = √(2×9.11e-31×8.01e-15) = 3.81e-22 kg·m/s → λ_e = 6.626e-34/3.81e-22 = 1.74e-12 m. Step 2: Estimate coherence length (L_c) from GRW localization: L_c ≈ σ√(2π) = 1e-7×√(2π) ≈ 2.51e-7 m. Step 3: Calculate time-of-flight (t_flight) = distance/velocity = 1.5m/√(2E_k/m_e) = 1.5/1.33e8 ≈ 1.13e-8 s. Step 4: Probability of no collapse during flight: P(0) = exp(-λt_flight) = exp(-1e-16×1.13e-8) ≈ 1 - 1.13e-24 ≈ 1. Step 5: Fringe visibility V = V_QM × P(0), where V_QM is standard quantum visibility. Since P(0)≈1, V ≈ V_QM. For double-slit, V_QM ≈ 1 when L_c >> slit separation (typically μm scale). Here L_c≈250μm >> λ_e, so full visibility maintained."}

Explanation:
1. The GRW localization effect is negligible here because:
   - The electron's flight time (~10ns) is too short for likely collapses (λ=1e-16/s gives expected collapses ≈1e-24)
   - The localization width σ=100nm is much larger than the electron wavelength (1.7pm)
2. Thus the experiment should show near-perfect quantum interference (visibility ≈1) as observed in Tonomura's experiment
3. GRW only becomes significant for macroscopic objects or much longer timescales
