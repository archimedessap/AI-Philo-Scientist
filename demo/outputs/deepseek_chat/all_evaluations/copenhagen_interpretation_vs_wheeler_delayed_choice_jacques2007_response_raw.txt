{"derivation": "Step 1: The experiment involves a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with a delayed choice of whether to insert or remove the output beam splitter (BS). The initial state of the photon is |\\psi_0\\rangle = |1\\rangle, where |1\\rangle represents the photon entering the first beam splitter. Step 2: The first beam splitter (BS1) transforms the state into a superposition: |\\psi_1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|2\\rangle + i|3\\rangle), where |2\\rangle and |3\\rangle are the two paths in the MZI. Step 3: The phase shift in one arm (say, |3\\rangle) introduces a relative phase \\phi: |\\psi_2\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|2\\rangle + ie^{i\\phi}|3\\rangle). Step 4: If the output beam splitter (BS2) is present, the state evolves to |\\psi_3\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}[(1 - e^{i\\phi})|4\\rangle + i(1 + e^{i\\phi})|5\\rangle], where |4\\rangle and |5\\rangle are the output ports. Step 5: The probability of detecting the photon at |4\\rangle is P_4 = |\\langle 4|\\psi_3\\rangle|^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\cos\\phi). Step 6: The fringe visibility V is defined as V = \\frac{P_{max} - P_{min}}{P_{max} + P_{min}}. For P_4, P_{max} = 1 and P_{min} = 0, so V = 1. Step 7: If BS2 is removed, the photon is detected in either |2\\rangle or |3\\rangle with equal probability, resulting in no interference and V = 0. Step 8: The delayed choice (quantum RNG) determines whether BS2 is present or not after the photon has entered the MZI. According to the Copenhagen interpretation, the wavefunction evolves unitarily until measurement, and the choice of measurement (presence/absence of BS2) determines whether interference occurs. The fringe visibility is thus V = 1 when BS2 is present and V = 0 when it is absent. Step 9: Since the choice is random, the expected fringe visibility is the average: V = \\frac{1 + 0}{2} = 0.5."}
