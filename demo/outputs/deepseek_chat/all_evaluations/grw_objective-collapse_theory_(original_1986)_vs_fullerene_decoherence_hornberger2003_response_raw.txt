Here is the step-by-step analysis and calculation using GRW theory:

The calculation shows that GRW theory predicts no measurable decoherence in this experiment because:
1) The total collapse rate Λ = Nλ is extremely small (8.4e-14 s^-1)
2) The time-of-flight is too short for significant hit probability
3) Even if a hit occurred, the 100 nm localization width would only partially decohere the 990 nm fringe pattern
4) The final visibility reduction is of order 10^-22 - completely negligible
