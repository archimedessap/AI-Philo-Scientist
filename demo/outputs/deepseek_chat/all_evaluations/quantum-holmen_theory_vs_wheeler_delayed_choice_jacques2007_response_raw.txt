{"derivation": "Step 1: The experiment involves a single photon in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a delayed choice (quantum RNG) to insert/remove the output beam splitter after the photon has entered. The fringe visibility is the observable, which depends on the coherence of the wavefunction. In Quantum-Holmen Theory, the wavefunction is subject to stochastic collapses with rate \\(\\lambda = 10^{-16}\\) s\u207b\u00b9 and localisation width \\(\\sigma = 10^{-7}\\) m. Step 2: The photon's wavefunction \\(|\\psi_t\\rangle\\) evolves under the Hamiltonian \\(H = H_0 + H_{int} + H_{stoch}\\), where \\(H_{stoch}\\) accounts for collapses. The collapse operator \\(L_i(r)\\) localises the photon's position with a Gaussian kernel. Step 3: The probability of a collapse occurring during the photon's traversal time \\(\\Delta t\\) is \\(P_{\\text{collapse}} = \\lambda \\Delta t\\). For a typical interferometer, \\(\\Delta t \\approx 10^{-9}\\) s, so \\(P_{\\text{collapse}} \\approx 10^{-25}\\), negligible. Step 4: Without collapses, the fringe visibility \\(V\\) is maximal (1) for a coherent superposition. The localisation effect reduces visibility as \\(V \\approx \\exp(-(\\Delta x)^2 / (4\\sigma^2))\\), where \\(\\Delta x\\) is the path separation. For \\(\\Delta x \\approx 10^{-3}\\) m (typical interferometer), \\(V \\approx \\exp(-10^{-6} / (4 \\times 10^{-14})) = \\exp(-2.5 \\times 10^7)\\) \\(\\approx 0\\). However, since \\(P_{\\text{collapse}}\\) is negligible, the dominant effect is the undisturbed wavefunction. Step 5: The delayed choice does not affect the fringe visibility in this theory because the stochastic collapses are independent of the choice timing. The final visibility is thus \\(V = 1\\), as the wavefunction remains coherent."}
