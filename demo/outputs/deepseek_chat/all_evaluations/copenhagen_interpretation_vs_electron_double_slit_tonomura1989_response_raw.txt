{"derivation": "Step 1: The electron wavefunction propagates through the biprism (double-slit analog) and evolves unitarily according to the Schr√∂dinger equation: $i\\hbar\\,\\partial_t\\,\\psi = H_{QM}\\,\\psi$, where $H_{QM} = \\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2m} + V(\\hat{r})$. The biprism splits the wavefunction into two coherent paths, analogous to a double-slit. Step 2: The wavefunction at the screen is the superposition of the two paths: $\\psi(x) = \\psi_1(x) + \\psi_2(x)$, where $\\psi_1(x)$ and $\\psi_2(x)$ are the wavefunctions from each path. Step 3: The intensity pattern on the screen is given by the Born rule: $I(x) = |\\psi(x)|^2 = |\\psi_1(x) + \\psi_2(x)|^2 = |\\psi_1(x)|^2 + |\\psi_2(x)|^2 + 2\\text{Re}[\\psi_1^*(x)\\psi_2(x)]$. The interference term $2\\text{Re}[\\psi_1^*(x)\\psi_2(x)]$ produces fringes. Step 4: The fringe visibility $V$ is defined as $V = \\frac{I_{\\text{max}} - I_{\\text{min}}}{I_{\\text{max}} + I_{\\text{min}}}$. For perfect coherence and equal amplitudes, $V = 1$. Step 5: For the given experiment (Tonomura et al., 1989), the coherence is nearly perfect, and the setup ensures equal amplitudes, so the predicted visibility is very close to 1."}
