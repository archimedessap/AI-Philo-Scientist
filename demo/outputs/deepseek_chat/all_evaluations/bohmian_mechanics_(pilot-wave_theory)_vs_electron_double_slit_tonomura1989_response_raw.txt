{"derivation": "Step 1: Define the wavefunction for the double-slit experiment. In Bohmian mechanics, the wavefunction evolves according to the Schr√∂dinger equation: \\(i\\hbar\\,\\partial_t\\,\\psi = H_{QM}\\,\\psi\\). For an electron with acceleration voltage 50 kV, the de Broglie wavelength is given by \\(\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}\\), where \\(p = \\sqrt{2m_e e V}\\). Step 2: Calculate the de Broglie wavelength. Plugging in the values: \\(V = 50\\,\\text{kV} = 50 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{V}\\), \\(m_e = 9.109 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\text{kg}\\), \\(e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C}\\), and \\(h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{s}\\), we get \\(\\lambda \\approx 5.36 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{m}\\). Step 3: The fringe visibility is determined by the interference pattern, which depends on the phase difference \\(\\Delta \\phi = \\frac{2\\pi d \\sin\\theta}{\\lambda}\\), where \\(d\\) is the effective slit separation (determined by the biprism) and \\(\\theta\\) is the angle to the screen. For maximum visibility, the phase difference must be an integer multiple of \\(2\\pi\\). Step 4: The fringe spacing \\(\\Delta y\\) on the screen is given by \\(\\Delta y = \\frac{\\lambda L}{d}\\), where \\(L = 1.5\\,\\text{m}\\) is the screen distance. The visibility \\(V\\) is maximal (1.0) for perfect interference, but in practice, it is reduced by decoherence effects. However, in Bohmian mechanics, the guiding equation \\(\\dot{\\mathbf q}_k = \\frac{\\hbar}{m_k}\\,\\Im\\!\\left(\\frac{\\\nabla_k \\psi}{\\psi}\\right)_{\\mathbf q(t)}\\) ensures that the trajectories reproduce the Born rule \\(|\\psi|^2\\), so the fringe visibility matches standard QM predictions. Step 5: For a well-designed biprism experiment like Tonomura's, the visibility is close to 1.0, as the wavefunction remains coherent and the guiding field ensures the interference pattern is observed."}
