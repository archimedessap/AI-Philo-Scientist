{"derivation": "Step 1: [Initial state] The single photon enters the Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) in state |\\psi_0\\rangle = |1\\rangle, where |1\\rangle represents the photon in the input port. The MZI splits this into a superposition |\\psi_1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|a\\rangle + |b\\rangle), where |a\\rangle and |b\\rangle are the two paths. Step 2: [GRW dynamics] The photon's wavefunction evolves under the GRW equation: d|\\psi_t\\rangle = \\Bigl(-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}H_{QM}dt + (L-1) dN(t)\\Bigr)|\\psi_t\\rangle. Here H_{QM} is the MZI Hamiltonian (unitary), and L = (\\pi\\sigma^2)^{-1/4} e^{-(\\hat{x}-x)^2/(2\\sigma^2)} is the localization operator (\\sigma = 10^{-7}m). Step 3: [Collapse probability] The probability of a GRW hit in time \\Delta t is P_{hit} = \\lambda \\Delta t = 10^{-16} \\Delta t. For a photon traversing the MZI (typical \\Delta t \\approx 10^{-9}s), P_{hit} \\approx 10^{-25}, so hits are negligible. Step 4: [Delayed choice] The electro-optic modulator (EOM) acts after the photon is already in superposition. If the EOM inserts the output beam splitter (BS), the final state is |\\psi_{final}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}(|c\\rangle + |d\\rangle), where |c\\rangle and |d\\rangle are output ports. If the EOM removes the BS, the state remains |\\psi_{final}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|a\\rangle + |b\\rangle). Step 5: [Fringe visibility] Fringe visibility V = \\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}}. With BS: I_{max} = 1, I_{min} = 0 \\Rightarrow V = 1. Without BS: no interference \\Rightarrow V = 0. The quantum RNG averages these: V = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 0 = 0.5. GRW hits are too rare to affect this."}
