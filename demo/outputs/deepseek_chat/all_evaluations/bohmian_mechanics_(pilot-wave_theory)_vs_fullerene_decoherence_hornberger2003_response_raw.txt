{"derivation": "Step 1: Define the system and initial conditions. The C70 fullerene (mass m = 840 amu ≈ 1.395 × 10⁻²⁴ kg) is described by a wavefunction ψ(q, t) in configuration space, with initial position distribution |ψ(q, 0)|². The particle's trajectory q(t) is guided by the phase of ψ via the guiding equation: \\dot{q} = \\frac{\\hbar}{m} \\Im\\left(\\frac{\\nabla_q \\psi}{\\psi}\\right). The interferometer setup (Talbot–Lau, grating period d = 990 nm) imposes a periodic boundary condition on ψ. Step 2: Model the thermal environment. The thermal source (T = 900 K) introduces decoherence via scattering events. The decoherence rate Γ is estimated by Γ ≈ nσv, where n is the gas density (negligible in high vacuum), σ is the scattering cross-section, and v is the velocity (100 m/s). For high vacuum, Γ ≈ 0, so unitary evolution dominates. Step 3: Solve the Schrödinger equation for ψ in the interferometer. The Talbot–Lau effect arises from the wavefunction's self-imaging after diffraction. The fringe visibility V is determined by the overlap of diffracted wavepackets: V = |\\langle \\psi_1 | \\psi_2 \\rangle|, where |\\psi_1\\rangle and |\\psi_2\\rangle are the paths. For pure states, V = 1. Step 4: Account for finite temperature effects. The thermal de Broglie wavelength λ_T = h/\\sqrt{2πmk_BT} ≈ 1.7 pm is much smaller than the grating period, so thermal smearing is negligible. Thus, V ≈ 1 (perfect visibility) in Bohmian mechanics, as trajectories remain coherent under unitary evolution."}
