{"derivation": "Step 1: The experiment involves a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with a delayed choice to insert or remove the output beam splitter (BS) after the photon has entered the interferometer. In Bohmian mechanics, the photon has a definite trajectory guided by the wavefunction. The wavefunction evolves unitarily according to the Schr√∂dinger equation: \\(i\\hbar\\,\\partial_t\\,\\psi = H_{QM}\\,\\psi\\). The photon's position \\(q(t)\\) evolves via the guiding equation: \\(\\dot{q}(t) = \\frac{\\hbar}{m}\\,\\Im\\!\\left(\\frac{\\nabla \\psi}{\\psi}\\right)_{q(t)}\\).\n\nStep 2: The MZI setup splits the initial wavefunction into two paths (upper and lower arms). The wavefunction before the second BS (if present) is \\(\\psi = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\psi_u + \\psi_l)\\), where \\(\\psi_u\\) and \\(\\psi_l\\) are the wavefunctions in the upper and lower arms, respectively. The guiding equation determines the photon's path based on the phase relationship between \\(\\psi_u\\) and \\(\\psi_l\\).\n\nStep 3: If the second BS is inserted, the wavefunction recombines, leading to interference. The fringe visibility \\(V\\) is determined by the overlap of \\(\\psi_u\\) and \\(\\psi_l\\): \\(V = |\\langle \\psi_u | \\psi_l \\rangle|\\). For perfect coherence, \\(V = 1\\). If the second BS is removed, the photon exits one of the two ports without interference, and \\(V = 0\\).\n\nStep 4: The delayed choice is made by a quantum RNG after the photon enters the MZI. In Bohmian mechanics, the photon's trajectory is already determined by the guiding equation, but the choice affects the wavefunction's evolution. The fringe visibility is thus \\(V = 1\\) if the BS is inserted (full interference) and \\(V = 0\\) if it is removed (no interference).\n\nStep 5: Since the choice is random and equally probable, the average fringe visibility is \\(V = 0.5 \\times 1 + 0.5 \\times 0 = 0.5\\). This matches the statistical prediction of standard QM under the quantum equilibrium hypothesis (\\(|\\psi|^2\\) distribution)."}
