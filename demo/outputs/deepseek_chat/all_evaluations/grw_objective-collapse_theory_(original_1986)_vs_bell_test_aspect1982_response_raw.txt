Here is the analysis of the Aspect (1982) Bell test experiment using the GRW objective-collapse theory:

{"derivation": "Step 1: The GRW theory modifies standard quantum mechanics by introducing spontaneous localization events ('hits') with rate $\\lambda = 10^{-16}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ per particle and localization width $\\sigma = 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m}$. For entangled photon pairs separated by $d = 6.5\\,\\text{m}$, the probability of a hit occurring during the measurement time $\\Delta t \\approx d/c \\approx 22\\,\\text{ns}$ is $P_{\\text{hit}} = \\lambda \\Delta t \\approx 2.2\\times10^{-24}$, which is negligible. Therefore, the entangled state $|\\psi\\rangle = (|HV\\rangle - |VH\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$ remains effectively undisturbed by GRW collapses during the experiment. Step 2: The CHSH inequality $S = |E(a,b) - E(a,b') + E(a',b) + E(a',b')| \\leq 2$ is calculated using correlation functions $E(\\theta_A,\\theta_B) = -\\cos[2(\\theta_A-\\theta_B)]$ for polarization measurements at angles $\\theta_A,\\theta_B$. Step 3: For optimal angles $(a,b,a',b') = (0^\\circ, 22.5^\\circ, 45^\\circ, 67.5^\\circ)$, we calculate each term: $E(0^\\circ,22.5^\\circ) = -\\cos(45^\\circ) = -1/\\sqrt{2}$, $E(0^\\circ,67.5^\\circ) = -\\cos(135^\\circ) = 1/\\sqrt{2}$, $E(45^\\circ,22.5^\\circ) = -\\cos(45^\\circ) = -1/\\sqrt{2}$, $E(45^\\circ,67.5^\\circ) = -\\cos(45^\\circ) = -1/\\sqrt{2}$. Step 4: Combining these gives $S = |-1/\\sqrt{2} - 1/\\sqrt{2} - 1/\\sqrt{2} - 1/\\sqrt{2}| = 2\\sqrt{2}$. The GRW collapses have negligible effect on this prediction because: (1) The collapse rate is extremely low for single photons, (2) The measurement time is too short for significant collapse probability, and (3) The localization width is much larger than the photon wavelength, preserving the entanglement."}
