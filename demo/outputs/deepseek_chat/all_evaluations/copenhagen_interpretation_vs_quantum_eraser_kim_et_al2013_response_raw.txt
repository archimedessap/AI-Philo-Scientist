{"derivation": "Step 1: The experiment involves polarization-entangled photon pairs, described by a joint wavefunction $\\psi(\\theta_1, \\theta_2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|H\\rangle_1|V\\rangle_2 - |V\\rangle_1|H\\rangle_2)$, where $|H\\rangle$ and $|V\\rangle$ are orthogonal polarization states. Step 2: The double slit tags each slit with orthogonal polarizations (e.g., slit A: $|H\\rangle$, slit B: $|V\\rangle$). The which-path information is thus encoded in the polarization state. Step 3: When which-path information is present (no eraser), the interference pattern vanishes because the system is in a mixed state: $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(|H\\rangle\\langle H| \\otimes |\\psi_A\\rangle\\langle\\psi_A| + |V\\rangle\\langle V| \\otimes |\\psi_B\\rangle\\langle\\psi_B|)$, where $|\\psi_A\\rangle$ and $|\\psi_B\\rangle$ are spatial wavefunctions for slits A and B. Step 4: The eraser method performs a delayed-choice measurement on the partner photon's polarization, projecting it onto $|\\pm\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|H\\rangle \\pm |V\\rangle)$. This erases the which-path information, restoring interference. The conditional wavefunction becomes $\\psi_{\\pm}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\psi_A(x) \\pm \\psi_B(x))$, yielding fringe visibility $V = \\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}}$. Step 5: For maximally entangled states and ideal erasure, the visibility is $V = 1$, as the interference terms $\\psi_A^*(x)\\psi_B(x) + \\psi_B^*(x)\\psi_A(x)$ are fully recovered."}
