{"derivation": "Step 1: The experiment involves electrons passing through a double-slit analog (electron biprism) and forming an interference pattern on a screen. According to the Copenhagen Interpretation, the electron's wavefunction ψ evolves unitarily via the Schrödinger equation until measurement. The Hamiltonian for a free electron (ignoring the biprism potential initially) is H_{QM} = \\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2m_e}, where m_e is the electron mass and \\hat{p} is the momentum operator. Step 2: The wavefunction after passing through the slits/biprism can be approximated as a superposition of two plane waves (from each 'slit'): ψ(x) ≈ ψ_1(x) + ψ_2(x), where ψ_i(x) ∝ e^{ikr_i}/r_i (i = 1,2), with r_i being the path length from slit i to point x on the screen, and k = p/ħ = \\sqrt{2m_eE}/ħ is the wavenumber. Step 3: The intensity/particle density at the screen is |ψ(x)|^2 = |ψ_1 + ψ_2|^2, which exhibits interference terms ∝ cos(kΔr), where Δr = r_1 - r_2 is the path difference. Step 4: For small angles (screen distance L ≫ slit separation d), Δr ≈ d sinθ ≈ dθ ≈ dx/L, where x is the position on the screen. The fringe spacing is Δx ≈ λL/d, where λ = h/p = h/\\sqrt{2m_eE} is the de Broglie wavelength. Step 5: For 50 keV electrons: E = 50 keV = 8.01 × 10^{-15} J, p = \\sqrt{2m_eE} = 1.21 × 10^{-22} kg·m/s, λ = h/p = 5.48 × 10^{-12} m. With L = 1.5 m and assuming a typical biprism 'slit' separation d ≈ 1 μm = 10^{-6} m, Δx ≈ (5.48 × 10^{-12} m)(1.5 m)/(10^{-6} m) ≈ 8.22 × 10^{-6} m. Step 6: Fringe visibility V = (I_max - I_min)/(I_max + I_min). For ideal two-slit interference, V = 1 (perfect visibility). Decoherence effects (not modeled here) would reduce V, but the Copenhagen Interpretation predicts V ≈ 1 for this setup."}
