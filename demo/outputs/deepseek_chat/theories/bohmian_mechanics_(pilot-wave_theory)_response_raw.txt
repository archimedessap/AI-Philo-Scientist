{"derivation": "Step 1: The experiment involves electron interference via a biprism (double-slit analog). In Bohmian mechanics, each electron has a definite trajectory guided by the wavefunction $\\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)$, which evolves unitarily via the Schr√∂dinger equation: $i\\hbar\\,\\partial_t\\,\\psi = H_{QM}\\,\\psi$. The biprism splits the wavefunction into two coherent parts, $\\psi = \\psi_1 + \\psi_2$, which later overlap and interfere. Step 2: The electron's velocity is determined by the guiding equation: $\\dot{\\mathbf{q}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{m}\\,\\Im\\!\\left(\\frac{\\nabla \\psi}{\\psi}\\right)_{\\mathbf{q}(t)}$. For $\\psi = \\psi_1 + \\psi_2$, this becomes $\\dot{\\mathbf{q}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{m}\\,\\Im\\!\\left(\\frac{\\nabla \\psi_1 + \\nabla \\psi_2}{\\psi_1 + \\psi_2}\\right)$. Step 3: The interference pattern arises from the phase difference $\\Delta \\phi$ between $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$. Writing $\\psi_j = |\\psi_j| e^{i\\phi_j}$, the velocity field becomes $\\dot{\\mathbf{q}} = \\frac{\\hbar}{m} \\nabla(\\phi_1 + \\phi_2) + \\text{terms depending on } |\\psi_j|$. Step 4: The fringe visibility $V$ is determined by the contrast in the probability density $|\\psi|^2 = |\\psi_1 + \\psi_2|^2$ at the screen. For equal amplitudes $|\\psi_1| = |\\psi_2| = A$, this gives $|\\psi|^2 = 2A^2(1 + \\cos(\\Delta \\phi))$, yielding maximal visibility $V = 1$. Step 5: The phase difference $\\Delta \\phi$ depends on the path difference $\\Delta L$: $\\Delta \\phi = \\frac{p\\,\\Delta L}{\\hbar}$, where $p = \\sqrt{2mE}$ is the electron momentum. For 50 kV acceleration, $E = 50\\,\\text{keV}$, giving $p \\approx 1.24 \\times 10^{-22}\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m/s}$. The biprism geometry determines $\\Delta L$, but the exact value is unspecified in the experiment. Thus, the visibility is theoretically $V = 1$ (maximal) for coherent overlapping wavefunctions."}
