Here is the analysis of the experiment using the Copenhagen interpretation:

{"derivation": "Step 1: The electron wavefunction evolves according to the Schr√∂dinger equation $i\\hbar\\,\\partial_t\\,\\psi = H_{QM}\\,\\psi$ where $H_{QM} = \\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2m} + V(\\hat{r})$. For free propagation between slits and screen, $V=0$. Step 2: The biprism creates two virtual sources (analogous to double slits) separated by distance $d$. The wavefunction at the screen is the superposition $\\psi(x) = \\psi_1(x) + \\psi_2(x)$ where each term represents propagation from one virtual source. Step 3: Using the Fresnel propagator for 50 keV electrons ($\\lambda \\approx 5.36\\times10^{-12}$ m), the intensity pattern is $I(x) = |\\psi(x)|^2 = I_0 \\cos^2(\\pi d x/\\lambda L)$ where $L=1.5$ m is screen distance. Step 4: Fringe visibility is defined as $V = (I_{max}-I_{min})/(I_{max}+I_{min})$. For perfect cosine fringes, this gives $V_{ideal}=1$. Step 5: Apply instrument corrections: $V = V_{ideal} \\times \\text{detection\\_efficiency} + \\text{systematic\\_bias} - \\text{resolution\\_smearing} = 1\\times0.92 - 0.02 - 0.005$. The background noise (0.01) is negligible for visibility calculation."}
{"value": 0.895}
``` 

The derivation shows:
1) Standard unitary evolution of the electron wavefunction
2) Superposition principle creating interference
3) Born rule giving the intensity pattern
4) Ideal visibility reduced by experimental factors
5) Final value incorporates all corrections from the instrument specifications
