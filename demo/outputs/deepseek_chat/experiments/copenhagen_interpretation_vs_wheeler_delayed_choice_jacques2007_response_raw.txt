{"derivation": "Step 1: [Initial state] The single photon enters the Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) in state |\\psi\\rangle = |1\\rangle, where |1\\rangle represents the photon in the input port. The MZI consists of two beam splitters (BS1, BS2) and mirrors. The first beam splitter (BS1) transforms the state into a superposition: |\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|A\\rangle + i|B\\rangle), where |A\\rangle and |B\\rangle are the two paths in the MZI. Step 2: [Unitary evolution] The photon evolves unitarily through the MZI. The phase difference between paths A and B is \\phi. The state before the second beam splitter (BS2) is |\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(e^{i\\phi_A}|A\\rangle + ie^{i\\phi_B}|B\\rangle), where \\phi_A and \\phi_B are the phases accumulated in paths A and B. Step 3: [Delayed choice] The electro-optic modulator (EOM) randomly inserts or removes BS2 after the photon has entered the MZI. If BS2 is present, the output state is |\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}[(e^{i\\phi_A} - e^{i\\phi_B})|C\\rangle + i(e^{i\\phi_A} + e^{i\\phi_B})|D\\rangle], where |C\\rangle and |D\\rangle are the output ports. If BS2 is absent, the photon exits in either |A\\rangle or |B\\rangle. Step 4: [Fringe visibility] The fringe visibility V is defined as V = \\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}}, where I_{max} and I_{min} are the maximum and minimum intensities at the output ports. For the case with BS2, the intensity at port C is I_C = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\cos(\\Delta\\phi)), where \\Delta\\phi = \\phi_A - \\phi_B. The visibility is V = 1. For the case without BS2, there is no interference, and V = 0. Step 5: [Statistical mixture] Since the choice to insert/remove BS2 is random (50/50), the observed visibility is the average: V_{obs} = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 0 = 0.5. Step 6: [Corrections] Apply instrument corrections: detection efficiency (0.82) reduces the visibility to V_{corr} = 0.5 * 0.82 = 0.41. Background noise (0.018) and systematic bias (-0.022) further adjust the value to V_{final} = 0.41 - 0.022 + 0.018 = 0.406."}
