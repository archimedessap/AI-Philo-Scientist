{"derivation": "Step 1: Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of the C70 fullerene. The de Broglie wavelength is given by \\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the particle. For a particle with mass m and velocity v, p = m v. Here, m = 840 amu = 840 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg and v = 100 m/s. Thus, \\lambda = \\frac{6.62607015e-34}{840 * 1.66053906660e-27 * 100} = 4.75e-12 m. Step 2: Calculate the Talbot length for the interferometer. The Talbot length is given by L_T = \\frac{d^2}{\\lambda}, where d is the grating period. Here, d = 990 nm = 990e-9 m. Thus, L_T = \\frac{(990e-9)^2}{4.75e-12} = 0.206 m. Step 3: Estimate the decoherence effects due to thermal radiation. The decoherence rate \\Gamma for a particle in a thermal environment is given by \\Gamma = \\frac{k_B T \\Lambda^2}{\\hbar}, where k_B is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and \\Lambda is the characteristic length scale of the system. Here, T = 900 K and \\Lambda \\approx d = 990e-9 m. Thus, \\Gamma = \\frac{1.380649e-23 * 900 * (990e-9)^2}{1.054571817e-34} = 1.15e11 s^-1. Step 4: Calculate the time of flight through the interferometer. The time of flight t is given by t = \\frac{L_T}{v} = \\frac{0.206}{100} = 2.06e-3 s. Step 5: Calculate the decoherence factor. The decoherence factor D is given by D = e^{-\\Gamma t} = e^{-1.15e11 * 2.06e-3} \\approx e^{-2.37e8} \\approx 0. Step 6: Calculate the fringe visibility. The fringe visibility V is given by V = V_0 D, where V_0 is the visibility without decoherence. For an ideal interferometer, V_0 = 1. Thus, V = 1 * 0 = 0. Step 7: Apply instrument corrections. The corrected visibility V' is given by V' = V * detection_efficiency + background_noise + systematic_bias = 0 * 0.88 + 0.015 - 0.025 = -0.01. However, visibility cannot be negative, so we take V' = 0."}
