{"derivation": "Step 1: Initialize the information density field $I(\\vec{r}, t)$ for the photon in the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The initial state corresponds to a localized information packet with coherence length $\\lambda_c \\approx 100$ nm (typical for single photons). The field evolves according to the TIE evolution equation: $\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial t} = D\\nabla^2 I - \\frac{1}{\\tau_{eq}}(I - I_0) + \\xi(\\vec{r},t)$, where $D$ is the information diffusion constant, $\\tau_{eq} \\approx 10^{-13}$ s is the equilibration time, and $\\xi$ represents sub-quantum fluctuations. Step 2: Model the beam splitter as an information potential barrier with transmission/reflection coefficients determined by thermodynamic stability constraints. The probability amplitudes emerge from the Boltzmann-like measurement rule: $P(a_i) = \\frac{e^{-\\beta \\Delta S_{info}(a_i)}}{\\sum_j e^{-\\beta \\Delta S_{info}(a_j)}}$, where $\\beta = (k_B T_{info})^{-1} \\approx 10^{7}$ K$^{-1}$. Step 3: The delayed choice occurs when the photon is already in the interferometer. The electro-optic modulator's action is modeled as a sudden change in the boundary conditions of $I(\\vec{r}, t)$, forcing the information field to re-equilibrate. The time-scale of this process ($\\sim 10^{-9}$ s) is slower than $\\tau_{eq}$, allowing complete adaptation. Step 4: Calculate fringe visibility $V$ as the normalized amplitude of the information density oscillation at the output: $V = \\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}}$. For a balanced Mach-Zehnder with delayed choice, TIE predicts perfect visibility $V = 1$ because the information field always fully adapts to the final configuration before detection, regardless of when the choice was made. The sub-quantum fluctuations $\\xi$ average out due to the thermodynamic stability constraints."}
