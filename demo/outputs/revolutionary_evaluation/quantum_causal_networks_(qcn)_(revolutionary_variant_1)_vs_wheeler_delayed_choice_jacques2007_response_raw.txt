Here is the analysis of the Wheeler delayed-choice experiment using Quantum Causal Networks (QCN) theory:

{"derivation": "Step 1: Represent the Mach-Zehnder interferometer as a causal network with nodes corresponding to optical elements and edges representing photon propagation paths. The network has nodes for input (I), beam splitter 1 (BS1), mirrors (M1,M2), optional output beam splitter (BS2), and detectors (D1,D2). Step 2: Model the quantum RNG choice as a topological fluctuation operator \\hat{T}_k acting on the causal connection between BS2 and detectors. The Hamiltonian term is \\lambda \\hat{T}_k where \\lambda ~ O(1). Step 3: The causal connection strength \\gamma_{ij} between BS1 and mirrors is \\gamma_{ij} ~ 1/\\ell_P^2 where \\ell_P is Planck length. Step 4: The full evolution is given by \\hat{H}_{QCN} = \\gamma_{BS1,M1} \\hat{C}_{BS1,M1} \\otimes \\hat{G}_{BS1,M1} + \\gamma_{BS1,M2} \\hat{C}_{BS1,M2} \\otimes \\hat{G}_{BS1,M2} + \\lambda \\hat{T}_{BS2}. Step 5: Calculate fringe visibility V as the normalized difference in detection probabilities: V = |P(D1) - P(D2)|/(P(D1) + P(D2)). Step 6: For the quantum superposition of causal paths, the geometric amplitude operators give \\hat{G}_{BS1,M1} = \\hat{G}_{BS1,M2} = 1/\\sqrt{2}. Step 7: The measurement probability is P(\\mathcal{C}) = Tr[\\hat{\\rho}_{\\mathcal{C}} \\prod_{l\\in\\mathcal{C}} \\hat{M}_l] where \\mathcal{C} represents the complete causal path. Step 8: When BS2 is inserted, interference occurs and V = |(1/2 + 1/2)^2 - 0|/1 = 1. When removed, V = |1/2 - 1/2|/1 = 0. Step 9: The quantum RNG creates a superposition of these outcomes, giving V = \\sqrt{(1)^2 + (0)^2}/\\sqrt{2} = 1/\\sqrt{2}."}
{"value": 0.71}

The derivation shows how the fringe visibility emerges from the quantum superposition of causal networks in QCN theory, with the final value of ~0.71 representing the characteristic visibility when the experiment exists in a quantum superposition of having/not having the second beam splitter.
