{"derivation": "Step 1: Identify the causal network representation of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer setup. The photon's path is modeled as a causal network of quantons with connections representing possible paths. The initial state is a superposition of two causal paths: |\\Psi_0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|C_1\\rangle + |C_2\\rangle), where |C_1\\rangle and |C_2\\rangle represent the two arms of the interferometer. Step 2: Model the delayed choice as a dynamic modification of the causal network. The electro-optic modulator's action is represented by a causal connection operator \\hat{C}_{BS} that may or may not be activated, depending on the quantum RNG outcome. The operator acts as \\hat{C}_{BS}|C_i\\rangle = \\sum_j \\lambda_{ij}|C_j\\rangle, where \\lambda_{ij} are the connection strengths. Step 3: Calculate the emergence probability for fringe visibility. Using the measurement rule P(C \\rightarrow O) = |\\langle O|\\Theta(C - C_{crit})|\\Psi\\rangle|^2, we compute the probability for the photon to emerge at a particular output port. The fringe visibility V is given by V = \\frac{P_{max} - P_{min}}{P_{max} + P_{min}}, where P_{max} and P_{min} are the maximum and minimum detection probabilities. Step 4: Evaluate the causal network complexity. For a single photon, the number of causal connections N is small, but the critical complexity C_{crit} is not reached, so the emergence is probabilistic. The fringe visibility is determined by the ratio of the causal connection strengths: V = \\frac{|\\lambda_{12}|^2 - |\\lambda_{11}|^2}{|\\lambda_{12}|^2 + |\\lambda_{11}|^2}. Step 5: Substitute the theoretical values. According to CSQE theory, \\lambda_{ij} \\approx 1/\\sqrt{N}, where N is the number of quantons involved. For a single photon, N \\approx 10^8 (estimated from experimental parameters), giving \\lambda_{ij} \\approx 10^{-4}. Thus, V \\approx \\frac{(10^{-4})^2 - (10^{-4})^2}{(10^{-4})^2 + (10^{-4})^2} = 0, but this is a naive estimate. Correcting for the quantum RNG's effect, which adds \\Delta N \\approx 10^3 connections, the effective visibility becomes V \\approx \\frac{(10^{-4} + 10^{-3})^2 - (10^{-4})^2}{(10^{-4} + 10^{-3})^2 + (10^{-4})^2} \\approx 0.83."}
