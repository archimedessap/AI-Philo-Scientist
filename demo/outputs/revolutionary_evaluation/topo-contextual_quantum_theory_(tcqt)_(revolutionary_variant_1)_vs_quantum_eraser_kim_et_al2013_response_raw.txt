{"derivation": "Step 1: Define the measurement context \\(\\mathcal{U}\\) for the quantum eraser experiment. In TCQT, the context includes the topological configuration of the double-slit setup and the polarization tagging. The context is parameterized by \\(\\tau\\), which encodes the eraser method (EOM-controlled delayed-choice measurement). The Hamiltonian \\(\\hat{H}_{\\tau}\\) is integrated over the context space \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) with measure \\(d\\mu_{\\tau}(t)\\): \\(\\hat{H}_{\\tau} = \\int_{\\mathcal{T}} \\hat{H}_t \\, d\\mu_{\\tau}(t)\\). Here, \\(\\hat{H}_t\\) represents the Hamiltonian contributions from the slit polarization and eraser dynamics. Step 2: The quantum state \\(\\Psi_{\\mathcal{U}}\\) is a section over the context \\(\\mathcal{U}\\). For the double-slit with orthogonal polarizations, the state is a superposition of two sheaf sections \\(\\Gamma(\\mathcal{U},E_1)\\) and \\(\\Gamma(\\mathcal{U},E_2)\\), corresponding to the two slits. The state is written as \\(\\Psi_{\\mathcal{U}} = \\alpha \\Gamma(\\mathcal{U},E_1) + \\beta \\Gamma(\\mathcal{U},E_2)\\), where \\(|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1\\). Step 3: The fringe visibility is determined by the coherence term \\(\\langle \\Gamma(\\mathcal{U},E_1) | \\Gamma(\\mathcal{U},E_2) \\rangle_{\\star}\\), where \\(\\star\\) is the non-commutative star-product for context joins. The topological coherence scale \\(\\kappa\\) governs this term: \\(\\langle \\Gamma(\\mathcal{U},E_1) | \\Gamma(\\mathcal{U},E_2) \\rangle_{\\star} = \\kappa \\exp(i\\phi)\\), where \\(\\phi\\) is the phase difference. Step 4: When which-path information is present (no eraser), \\(\\kappa = 0\\) due to the orthogonality of the polarization tags. The fringe visibility is zero. When the eraser is applied, \\(\\kappa\\) is restored to a value depending on the context join. For maximal erasure, \\(\\kappa = 1\\). Step 5: The fringe visibility \\(V\\) is given by the norm of the coherence term: \\(V = \\| \\langle \\Gamma(\\mathcal{U},E_1) | \\Gamma(\\mathcal{U},E_2) \\rangle_{\\star} \\|_{\\star} = \\kappa\\). For the experiment with full erasure, \\(V = 1\\)."}
