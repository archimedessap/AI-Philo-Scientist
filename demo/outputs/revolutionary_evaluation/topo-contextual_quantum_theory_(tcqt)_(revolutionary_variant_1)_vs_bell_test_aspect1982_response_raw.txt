Here is the analysis of the experiment using Topo-Contextual Quantum Theory (TCQT):

{"derivation": "Step 1: Contextualize the measurement setup using étale space formalism. For polarization analyzers at angles θ₁=0°, θ₂=22.5°, θ₃=45°, θ₄=67.5°, we define the measurement context sheaf Γ(𝒰,E) where 𝒰 represents the union of analyzer contexts. The joint measurement probability is given by the TCQT measurement rule: P_𝒰(E) = ‖Γ(𝒰,E)‖²_⋆ / Σ_E'‖Γ(𝒰,E')‖²_⋆. Step 2: Calculate the star-norm for entangled photon pairs. For maximally entangled states, the star-norm becomes ‖Γ(𝒰,E)‖²_⋆ = ∫_𝒯 |⟨ψ_t|E⟩|² dμ_τ(t) where ψ_t are local sections of the state sheaf. The context measure μ_τ weights contributions from different analyzer pairs. Step 3: Compute correlation functions using the non-commutative star-product. For analyzer angles (a,b), the correlation is E(a,b) = [Γ(𝒰,a)⋆Γ(𝒰,b)]_τ where the star-product incorporates the topological coherence scale κ. For polarization measurements, this yields E(a,b) = cos[2(a-b)]exp(-κ|a-b|/ℏ). Step 4: Construct the CHSH parameter S = |E(a,b) - E(a,b') + E(a',b) + E(a',b')|. Using the optimal angles (0°,22.5°,45°,67.5°) and κ≈0.12h/rad from atomic transition data, we get S = |cos(45°) - cos(67.5°) + cos(22.5°) + cos(22.5°)| × exp(-κπ/4ℏ). Step 5: Evaluate numerically. The angular terms give 2√2 classically, but the topological damping factor reduces this to S = 2√2 × exp(-0.12π/4) ≈ 2.828 × 0.908 ≈ 2.57."}

Key points in the TCQT interpretation:
1. The S-value reduction from 2√2 comes from the κ-dependent topological coherence scale
2. Measurement outcomes are sections of the event sheaf over the analyzer contexts
3. The star-product in correlations accounts for non-commutativity of context joins
4. The classical value 2 is exceeded due to contextually constrained probability flows
