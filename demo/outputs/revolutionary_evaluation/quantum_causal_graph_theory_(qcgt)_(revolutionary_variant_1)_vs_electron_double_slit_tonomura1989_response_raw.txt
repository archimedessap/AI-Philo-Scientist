{"derivation": "Step 1: Define the quantum state of the causal graph for the double-slit experiment. In QCGT, the electron's path is represented as a superposition of edges in the causal graph: |\\Psi_G\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|e_1\\rangle + |e_2\\rangle), where |e_1\\rangle and |e_2\\rangle represent the two possible paths through the slits. Step 2: The Hamiltonian for the electron's evolution includes the graph term and the matter term: \\hat{H}_{QCGT} = \\sum_{e\\in E} \\hat{J}_e \\hat{\\sigma}_e + \\lambda \\sum_{v\\in V} \\hat{\\mathcal{E}}_v \\hat{\\rho}_v. Here, \\hat{J}_e represents the quantum geometric coupling on edge e, and \\hat{\\mathcal{E}}_v represents the energy at vertex v. Step 3: The evolution equation includes a decoherence term: i\\hbar \\frac{d}{dt} |\\Psi_G\\rangle = \\left(\\hat{H}_{graph} + \\hat{H}_{matter}\\right) |\\Psi_G\\rangle - \\gamma \\hat{D}[\\rho_G]. The decoherence operator \\hat{D}[\\rho_G] accounts for the fundamental discreteness of the graph. Step 4: The fringe visibility V is given by the coherence of the quantum state: V = |\\langle e_1|e_2\\rangle|. In QCGT, this is modified by the graph decoherence: V_{QCGT} = V_0 e^{-\\gamma t}, where V_0 is the standard quantum mechanical visibility and t is the time of flight. Step 5: Calculate V_0 using the standard double-slit formula: V_0 = \\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}} = 1 for perfect coherence. Step 6: The time of flight t is given by the screen distance and electron velocity: t = \\frac{1.5 m}{v}. The electron velocity v is determined by the acceleration voltage: v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 e V}{m_e}} \\approx 1.33 \\times 10^8 m/s for 50 kV. Thus, t \\approx 1.13 \\times 10^{-8} s. Step 7: The decoherence rate \\gamma is given as ~10^-46 s^-1. Thus, the decoherence factor is negligible: e^{-\\gamma t} \\approx 1. Step 8: The final fringe visibility is V_{QCGT} \\approx 1."}
