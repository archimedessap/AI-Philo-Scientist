{"derivation": "Step 1: [Network Coherence Scale Calculation] The fundamental scale of quantum network coherence is given by the Planck length: $l_P = \\sqrt{\\hbar G/c^3} \\approx 1.616 \\times 10^{-35} \\text{m}$. This represents the minimal scale at which causal connections can form in the network. Step 2: [Causal Coupling Strength] The causal coupling $g_C$ is dimensionless and represents the strength of causal connection formation. For this experiment, we estimate $g_C \\approx 1$ (maximal coupling) due to the high vacuum environment minimizing external decoherence sources. Step 3: [Network Proper Time Evolution] The evolution of the quantum state is governed by $i\\hbar \\frac{d}{d\\tau} |\\Phi\\rangle = \\hat{H}_{QCN} |\\Phi\\rangle$, where $\\tau$ is the emergent network proper time. For the C70 fullerene, we model its propagation as a quantum walk on the causal network. Step 4: [Decoherence from Network Connectivity] Decoherence emerges from the connectivity pattern of the network. The fringe visibility $V$ is given by the network scattering amplitude: $V = |\\langle \\Phi_f|\\hat{S}|\\Phi_i \\rangle|^2$, where $\\hat{S}$ is the scattering operator encoding the Talbot-Lau interferometer geometry. Step 5: [Mass-Induced Decoherence] In QCNT, massive objects like C70 (840 amu) cause network decoherence through the term $\\lambda \\sum_{i,j,k} C_{ijk} \\hat{\\Psi}_i^\\dagger \\hat{\\Psi}_j \\hat{\\Psi}_k$ in the Hamiltonian, where $\\lambda \\propto m$. This leads to visibility reduction $V = \\exp(-(m/m_0)^2)$, with $m_0 \\approx 100$ amu being the characteristic mass scale for significant decoherence. Step 6: [Numerical Calculation] For C70 (m = 840 amu): $V = \\exp(-(840/100)^2) = \\exp(-70.56) \\approx 0.000$ (effectively complete decoherence at this mass scale)."}
