{"derivation": "Step 1: Calculate the relational complexity operator \\hat{C} for the C70 fullerene system. In SRQD, \\hat{C} measures the entanglement complexity between the system (C70) and its environment (thermal source at 900 K). For a massive particle in a thermal environment, \\hat{C} is proportional to the thermal de Broglie wavelength \\lambda_{th} and the system's mass m: \\hat{C} = \\alpha m k_B T / \\hbar^2, where \\alpha is the complexity sensitivity parameter (10^-23 J^-1), k_B is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature (900 K), and \\hbar is reduced Planck's constant. Plugging in values: \\hat{C} = (10^-23 J^-1)(840*1.66e-27 kg)(1.38e-23 J/K)(900 K)/(1.05e-34 Js)^2 = 1.53e10 (dimensionless). Step 2: Compute the scale-dependent decoherence function \\gamma(\\hat{C}) = \\gamma_0 (1 - e^{-\\lambda_R \\hat{C}}). With \\gamma_0 = 10^12 s^-1 and \\lambda_R = 1, we get \\gamma = 10^12 (1 - e^{-1.53e10}) ≈ 10^12 s^-1 (since e^{-1.53e10} is negligible). Step 3: Determine the decoherence time t_d = 1/\\gamma ≈ 1 ps. Step 4: Calculate the Talbot time t_T = d/v, where d = 990 nm is grating period and v = 100 m/s is velocity: t_T = 990e-9 m / 100 m/s = 9.9 ns. Step 5: The fringe visibility V is given by V = exp(-t_T/t_d) = exp(-9.9 ns / 1 ps) = exp(-9900) ≈ 0, showing complete decoherence due to the massive relational complexity of the C70-environment system at 900 K."}
