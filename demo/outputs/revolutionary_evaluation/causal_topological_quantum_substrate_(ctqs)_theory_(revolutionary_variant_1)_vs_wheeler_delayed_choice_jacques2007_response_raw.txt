{"derivation": "Step 1: Identify the causal configuration of the experiment. The Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) setup defines a discrete causal network where the photon's path corresponds to a sequence of spacetime grains. The causal connection strength between grains is given by \\kappa_{xy} ~ 1/\\ell_P^2, where \\ell_P is the Planck length. The topological constraint operator \\hat{C}_S enforces the interferometric paths to satisfy certain connectivity conditions. Step 2: Model the delayed choice as a dynamical constraint. The electro-optic modulator's action is represented by a time-dependent topological constraint \\lambda_S(\\tau), where \\tau is the causal time parameter. The quantum RNG ensures this constraint is applied after the photon enters the interferometer, corresponding to a non-local causal connection. Step 3: Apply the core Hamiltonian \\hat{H}_{CTQS} = \\sum_{x,y\\in\\mathcal{C}} \\kappa_{xy} \\hat{T}_{xy} + \\sum_{S\\in\\mathcal{T}} \\lambda_S \\hat{C}_S to the photon's causal configuration. The fringe visibility is determined by the decoherence operator \\hat{\\mathcal{D}}, which arises from causal horizon effects. Step 4: Calculate the transition probability P(\\mathcal{C}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{C}') using the measurement rule P(\\mathcal{C}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{C}') = \\frac{|\\langle\\mathcal{C}'|\\hat{\\mathcal{D}}|\\mathcal{C}\\rangle|^2}{\\sum_{\\mathcal{C}''}|\\langle\\mathcal{C}''|\\hat{\\mathcal{D}}|\\mathcal{C}\\rangle|^2}. The fringe visibility is proportional to the overlap integral of the causal configurations with and without the output beam splitter. Step 5: Solve the evolution equation i\\hbar_{eff}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\tau}\\Psi[\\mathcal{C}] = \\left(\\sum_{\\Delta\\in\\mathcal{C}} \\hat{\\Phi}_{\\Delta} - \\mu\\hat{\\mathcal{D}}\\right)\\Psi[\\mathcal{C}] for the photon's wavefunction \\Psi[\\mathcal{C}]. The solution shows that the fringe visibility is maximized when the topological constraints \\lambda_S are balanced, leading to constructive interference."}
