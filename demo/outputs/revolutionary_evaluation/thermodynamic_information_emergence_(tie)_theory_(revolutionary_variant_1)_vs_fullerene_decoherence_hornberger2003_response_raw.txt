{"derivation": "Step 1: Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of the fullerene molecule. The de Broglie wavelength is given by \\lambda_{dB} = \\frac{h}{p}, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the particle. For a C70 molecule with mass m = 840 amu = 1.395e-24 kg and velocity v = 100 m/s, the momentum p = mv = 1.395e-22 kg m/s. Thus, \\lambda_{dB} = \\frac{6.626e-34}{1.395e-22} = 4.75e-12 m. Step 2: Determine the coherence length \\lambda_c from TIE theory. The coherence length is system-dependent and given as \\lambda_c \\approx 1-100 nm. For this massive molecule, we take \\lambda_c = 10 nm (1e-8 m), as it is intermediate in the range and accounts for the large mass. Step 3: Calculate the fringe visibility V. In TIE theory, fringe visibility is determined by the ratio of the coherence length to the de Broglie wavelength, modulated by the information temperature T_info. The formula is V = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda_{dB}^2}{\\lambda_c^2}\\right) \\times \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_{env}}{T_{info}}\\right), where T_env is the environmental temperature (900 K) and T_info is the information temperature (1e-7 K). The first term accounts for spatial decoherence, and the second term for thermal decoherence. Plugging in the values: V = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(4.75e-12)^2}{(1e-8)^2}\\right) \\times \\exp\\left(-\\frac{900}{1e-7}\\right). The first exponential term is approximately \\exp(-2.256e-7) \\approx 1, and the second term is \\exp(-9e9) \\approx 0. Thus, V \\approx 0."}
