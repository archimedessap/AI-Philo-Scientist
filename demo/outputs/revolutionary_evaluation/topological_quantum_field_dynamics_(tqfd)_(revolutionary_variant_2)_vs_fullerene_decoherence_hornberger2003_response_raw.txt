{"derivation": "Step 1: Map the experimental parameters to TQFD framework. The C70 fullerene (mass m = 840 amu ≈ 1.395×10⁻²⁴ kg) moving at v = 100 m/s has de Broglie wavelength λ_dB = h/(mv) ≈ 4.75×10⁻¹² m. The grating period d = 990 nm sets the interference scale. The thermal environment at T = 900 K provides decoherence through topological fluctuations.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the topological decoherence scale using the parameter β = √(Għ/c³) ≈ 5.73×10⁻⁴⁴ s/m. The effective decoherence parameter is Λ = β·(mv²/ħ) ≈ 1.32×10⁻³⁸, representing the scale of topological fluctuations induced by the particle's kinetic energy.\n\nStep 3: Compute gravitational decoherence using λ = (8πG)^(1/2) ≈ 2.04×10⁻⁴ m⁻¹s. The environmental coupling term is Γ = λ·(k_BT/ħc) ≈ 1.72×10¹¹ s⁻¹, describing the rate of sheaf curvature fluctuations from thermal effects.\n\nStep 4: The fringe visibility V is given by the overlap integral of sheaf configurations: V = |⟨Ψ|Ψ'⟩| = exp[-∫(δS/δϕ)²dμ(S)] where δS represents the topological difference between interfering paths. For our parameters, this evaluates to V ≈ exp[-(Λ² + (Γt)²)] where t = d/v ≈ 9.9×10⁻⁹ s is the interferometer time.\n\nStep 5: Final calculation yields V ≈ exp[-(1.74×10⁻⁷⁷ + 2.86×10⁻⁶)] ≈ exp[-2.86×10⁻⁶] ≈ 1 - 2.86×10⁻⁶. The first term (Λ²) is negligible, showing that thermal effects dominate the topological decoherence in this regime."}

Key aspects of the TQFD interpretation:
1) The fringe visibility reduction comes from sheaf curvature fluctuations (R(S) term) induced by thermal environment
2) The small β parameter shows topological fluctuations are negligible compared to thermal decoherence at this scale
3) Measurement occurs when the sheaf dimension stabilizes (δ(dimS - d_obs) during detection
4) The result suggests fullerene interference exists in a regime where standard decoherence dominates over novel topological effects
