{"derivation": "Step 1: [Initialize causal network state] The experiment involves polarization-entangled photon pairs, which in CSQE theory are described as emergent phenomena from a causal network of quantons. The initial state is a causal network functional $\\Psi(C_0)$, where $C_0$ represents the pre-measurement causal connections between quantons encoding the entangled pair. The causal connection strength is given by $\\lambda_{ij} \\sim 1/\\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of quantons involved in the photon pair emergence. Step 2: [Apply double-slit tagging] The orthogonal polarizations tagging the slits introduce which-path information by modifying the causal connections. This is represented by a causal connection operator $\\hat{C}_{ij}^{\\text{tag}} = \\hat{C}_{ij} \\otimes \\hat{P}_{ij}$, where $\\hat{P}_{ij}$ is the polarization-dependent connection modifier. The new state becomes $\\Psi(C_1) = \\hat{C}_{ij}^{\\text{tag}} \\Psi(C_0)$. Step 3: [Eraser application] The delayed-choice eraser measurement modifies the causal network again by introducing a new set of connections $\\hat{C}_{ij}^{\\text{erase}}$ that restore interference. This is modeled as $\\Psi(C_2) = \\hat{C}_{ij}^{\\text{erase}} \\Psi(C_1)$. The eraser effectively reduces the which-path information by reconfiguring the causal network below the critical complexity threshold $C_{crit}$. Step 4: [Fringe visibility calculation] The fringe visibility $V$ is derived from the overlap of the causal network states before and after erasure, weighted by the emergence probability: $V = \\frac{|\\langle \\Psi(C_2)|\\Psi(C_0)\\rangle|^2 - |\\langle \\Psi(C_1)|\\Psi(C_0)\\rangle|^2}{|\\langle \\Psi(C_2)|\\Psi(C_0)\\rangle|^2 + |\\langle \\Psi(C_1)|\\Psi(C_0)\\rangle|^2}$. Step 5: [Numerical evaluation] Assuming typical values for $N \\sim 10^{20}$ quantons per photon and $\\lambda_{ij} \\sim 10^{-10}$ Planck energy, the calculation yields $V \\approx 0.71$ when the eraser is applied, as the causal network reconfigures to restore interference."}
