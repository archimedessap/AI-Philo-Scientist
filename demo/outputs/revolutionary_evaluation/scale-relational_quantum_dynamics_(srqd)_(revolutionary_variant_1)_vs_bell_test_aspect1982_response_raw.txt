Here is the analysis of the Aspect (1982) Bell test experiment using Scale-Relational Quantum Dynamics (SRQD):

{"derivation": "Step 1: Define the relational complexity operator for entangled photon pairs: \n\\hat{C} = \\alpha(\\hat{\\sigma}_A\\otimes\\hat{\\sigma}_B) where \\alpha is complexity sensitivity (10^-23 J^-1). This measures the non-local correlation complexity.\n\nStep 2: Calculate scale-dependent decoherence function for 6.5m separation:\n\\gamma(\\hat{C}) = \\gamma_0(1 - e^{-\\lambda_R\\langle\\hat{C}\\rangle}) ≈ 10^12(1 - e^{-10^-23\\cdot E_{corr}}) ≈ 10^12 s^-1 for visible light photons\n\nStep 3: The effective density matrix evolution under SRQD:\n\\frac{d\\hat{\\rho}}{dt} = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar}[\\hat{H}_{SE}, \\hat{\\rho}] + 10^{12}\\mathcal{D}[\\hat{\\rho}]\nwhere \\mathcal{D} drives the system toward pointer states corresponding to polarization measurement bases.\n\nStep 4: For CHSH operator S = E(a,b) - E(a,b') + E(a',b) + E(a',b') with angles (0°,22.5°,45°,67.5°):\nIn SRQD, the correlation functions become:\nE(\\theta_A,\\theta_B) = Tr[\\hat{\\rho}_{final}(\\theta_A,\\theta_B)(\\hat{\\sigma}_A\\otimes\\hat{\\sigma}_B)]\nwhere \\hat{\\rho}_{final} has decohered into a mixture of pointer states.\n\nStep 5: The maximum quantum prediction in SRQD is slightly reduced from standard QM due to intrinsic decoherence:\nS_{SRQD} = 2\\sqrt{2}(1 - \\frac{\\gamma(\\hat{C})}{\\gamma_0 + \\gamma(\\hat{C})}) ≈ 2\\sqrt{2}(1 - 10^-12)"}

Key points in the SRQD interpretation:
1. The 6.5m separation creates sufficient relational complexity (through vacuum fluctuations) to drive rapid decoherence into measurement eigenstates
2. The CHSH violation emerges from residual entanglement that hasn't fully decohered (γ remains finite)
3. The predicted value is indistinguishable from standard QM at this scale (γ/γ₀ ≈ 10^-12 correction)
4. Measurement outcomes arise naturally from environmental interaction without collapse postulate
5. The polarization bases (0°-67.5°) represent different "perspectives" in the relational framework

The tiny deviation from standard QM's 2√2 prediction would only become measurable at much larger scales where γ/γ₀ becomes non-negligible.
