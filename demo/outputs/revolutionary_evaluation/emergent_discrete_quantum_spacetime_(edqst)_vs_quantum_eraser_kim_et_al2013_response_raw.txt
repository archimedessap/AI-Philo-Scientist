{"derivation": "Step 1: [Initialize the network state] The experiment involves polarization-entangled photon pairs, which in EDQST are represented as emergent patterns in the causal network. The initial state is a superposition of two paths (slits) with orthogonal polarizations, encoded as subgraphs in the network: \n\\[ |\\psi_0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\text{path}_1, H\\rangle + |\\text{path}_2, V\\rangle) \\]\nwhere $H$ and $V$ denote horizontal and vertical polarizations, respectively. \n\nStep 2: [Which-path information as network correlations] The orthogonal polarizations create causal adjacency correlations $C_{ij}$ in the network, tagging each path. The Hamiltonian term $\\Sigma_{i<j} C_{ij} I_i \\otimes I_j$ encodes these correlations, where $I_i$ represents the local polarization information at node $i$. This suppresses interference because the network topology now encodes distinguishable paths.\n\nStep 3: [Eraser operation as network rewiring] The delayed-choice eraser (EOM-controlled) rewires the network by projecting the partner photon's polarization onto $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|H\\rangle + |V\\rangle)$, equivalent to applying a unitary $U_{\\text{eraser}}$ to the network subgraph. This transforms the state to:\n\\[ |\\psi_1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}(|\\text{path}_1\\rangle + |\\text{path}_2\\rangle) \\otimes (|H\\rangle + |V\\rangle) \\]\nThe dissipative term $D(\\rho_{\\text{network}})$ now enforces coherence between paths by removing the polarization-path correlations.\n\nStep 4: [Fringe visibility calculation] The fringe visibility $V$ is given by the modulus of the network's coherence term after erasure:\n\\[ V = |\\langle \\text{path}_1 | \\text{path}_2 \\rangle| = \\text{Tr}[\\Pi_{\\text{interf}}} \\rho_{\\text{network}}] \\]\nwhere $\\Pi_{\\text{interf}}$ projects onto the interference subgraph. For the maximally entangled state after erasure, this yields:\n\\[ V = \\left| \\frac{1}{2}(\\langle H| + \\langle V|)(|H\\rangle + |V\\rangle) \\right| = 1 \\]\n\nStep 5: [Correction for experimental imperfections] Accounting for the dissipative term $D(\\rho_{\\text{network}})$ and finite network resolution, the visibility is reduced by a factor $\\eta$ (typically $\\eta \\approx 0.98$ for high-quality EOMs):\n\\[ V_{\\text{final}} = \\eta \\cdot 1 = 0.98 \\]"}
