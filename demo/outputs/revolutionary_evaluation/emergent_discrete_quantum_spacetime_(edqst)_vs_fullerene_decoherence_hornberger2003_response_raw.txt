Here is the analysis of the experiment using the Emergent Discrete Quantum Spacetime (EDQST) theory:

{"derivation": "Step 1: [Network Hamiltonian] The unified Hamiltonian for the C70 fullerene in the interferometer is given by $H_{\\text{network}} = \\sum_{i<j} C_{ij} I_i \\otimes I_j + \\lambda \\sum_k T_k$, where $C_{ij}$ represents causal adjacency operators between network nodes (discrete spacetime events), $I_i$ is local information at node $i$, and $T_k$ encodes topological constraints of the interferometer setup. The term $\\lambda$ scales gravitational effects, which are negligible here. Step 2: [Dissipative Evolution] The evolution of the network density matrix includes a dissipative term $D(\\rho_{\\text{network}})$ that enforces discreteness: $\\partial_t \\rho_{\\text{network}} = -i[H_{\\text{network}}, \\rho_{\\text{network}}] + D(\\rho_{\\text{network}})$. The dissipative term causes decoherence by suppressing off-diagonal elements in the position basis. Step 3: [Fringe Visibility Calculation] The fringe visibility $V$ emerges from the network's information propagation and is given by $V = \\exp(-\\Gamma t)$, where $\\Gamma$ is the decoherence rate. In EDQST, $\\Gamma$ depends on the network's causal structure and is approximated by $\\Gamma \\approx \\frac{\\Lambda^2 v^2}{\\Delta x^2} t$, where $\\Lambda$ is the fundamental discreteness scale (Planck length), $v$ is the velocity (100 m/s), and $\\Delta x$ is the grating period (990 nm). Step 4: [Numerical Evaluation] Using $\\Lambda \\approx 1.6 \\times 10^{-35}$ m (Planck length), $t \\approx \\frac{L}{v}$ with interferometer length $L \\sim 1$ m, we compute $\\Gamma t \\approx \\frac{(1.6 \\times 10^{-35})^2 (100)^2}{(990 \\times 10^{-9})^2} \\approx 2.6 \\times 10^{-54}$, yielding $V \\approx \\exp(-2.6 \\times 10^{-54}) \\approx 1 - 2.6 \\times 10^{-54} \\approx 1$."}

The derivation shows that in EDQST, the massive C70 fullerene's wave-like behavior is preserved (fringe visibility ~1) because the fundamental discreteness of spacetime ($\\Lambda$) is so small that decoherence from the network's dissipative dynamics is negligible at laboratory scales. The result aligns with the philosophical view that quantum coherence emerges robustly from the discrete causal network unless strongly perturbed.
