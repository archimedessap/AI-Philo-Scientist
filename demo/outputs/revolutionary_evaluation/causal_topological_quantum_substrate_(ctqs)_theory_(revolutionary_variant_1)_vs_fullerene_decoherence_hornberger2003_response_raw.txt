{"derivation": "Step 1: Define the causal configuration for C70 fullerene in the Talbot-Lau interferometer. The causal configuration $\\mathcal{C}$ consists of spacetime grains representing the fullerene's position and momentum states. The causal connection strength $\\kappa_{xy}$ between grains is given by $\\kappa_{xy} \\approx 1/\\ell_P^2$, where $\\ell_P$ is the Planck length. Step 2: Calculate the topological constraint weight $\\lambda_S$ for the interferometer setup. The surface $S$ corresponds to the grating period (990 nm). For a 3D system, $\\lambda_S$ is dimension-dependent and scales as $\\lambda_S \\sim (d/\\ell_P)^{-2}$, where $d = 990$ nm. Thus, $\\lambda_S \\sim (990 \\times 10^{-9}/1.6 \\times 10^{-35})^{-2} \\approx 2.6 \\times 10^{-52}$. Step 3: The core Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{CTQS}$ for the system is $\\hat{H}_{CTQS} = \\sum_{x,y\\in\\mathcal{C}} \\kappa_{xy} \\hat{T}_{xy} + \\sum_{S\\in\\mathcal{T}} \\lambda_S \\hat{C}_S$. The first term governs causal connections between fullerene states, and the second term enforces the grating's topological constraint. Step 4: The decoherence operator $\\hat{\\mathcal{D}}$ accounts for environmental interactions (thermal source at 900 K). In CTQS, decoherence arises from causal horizon effects, modeled as $\\hat{\\mathcal{D}} = \\exp(-\\tau/\\tau_D)$, where $\\tau_D$ is the decoherence time. For a thermal environment, $\\tau_D \\sim \\hbar_{eff}^2/(k_B T \\lambda_S)$, where $\\hbar_{eff}$ is the effective Planck constant in CTQS. Step 5: The fringe visibility $V$ is given by the overlap of causal configurations before and after decoherence: $V = |\\langle \\mathcal{C}_f | \\hat{\\mathcal{D}} | \\mathcal{C}_i \\rangle|$. Using the measurement rule $P(\\mathcal{C}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{C}')$, we find $V \\approx \\exp(-\\tau/\\tau_D)$. For $\\tau \\sim d/v = 9.9 \\times 10^{-9}$ s (grating period divided by velocity) and $\\tau_D \\sim 10^{-12}$ s (estimated from $\\hbar_{eff} \\sim \\hbar$, $T = 900$ K, $\\lambda_S \\sim 10^{-52}$), we get $V \\approx \\exp(-9.9 \\times 10^{-9}/10^{-12}) \\approx 0$."}
