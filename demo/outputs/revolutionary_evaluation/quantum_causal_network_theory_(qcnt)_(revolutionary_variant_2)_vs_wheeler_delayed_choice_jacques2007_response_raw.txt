{"derivation": "Step 1: [Initialize the quantum causal network for the experiment] The experiment involves a single photon traversing a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a delayed choice of inserting/removing the output beam splitter. In QCNT, this setup is represented as a dynamic causal network where each optical element (beam splitters, mirrors, detectors) corresponds to a node in the network, and the photon's path corresponds to causal connections between nodes. The fundamental Hamiltonian is given by: \\[\\hat{H}_{QCN} = \\sum_{i,j} w_{ij}(\\hat{\\Psi}_i^\\dagger \\hat{\\Psi}_j) + \\lambda \\sum_{i,j,k} C_{ijk} \\hat{\\Psi}_i^\\dagger \\hat{\\Psi}_j \\hat{\\Psi}_k + h.c.\\] where $\\hat{\\Psi}_i$ represents the quantum operator for a causal event at node $i$, $w_{ij}$ is the causal connection weight between nodes $i$ and $j$, and $C_{ijk}$ captures higher-order causal correlations. Step 2: [Model the delayed choice mechanism] The delayed choice is implemented via an electro-optic modulator controlled by a quantum RNG, which is treated as a dynamical node in the network. The choice to insert/remove the beam splitter occurs after the photon has entered the interferometer, which in QCNT means the causal connections are updated dynamically based on the RNG outcome. The probability amplitude for the photon to take a particular path is given by the network scattering amplitude: \\[P(A\\rightarrow B) = |\\langle \\Phi_B|\\hat{S}_{AB}|\\Phi_A \\rangle|^2\\] where $|\\Phi_A\\rangle$ and $|\\Phi_B\\rangle$ are the initial and final network states, and $\\hat{S}_{AB}$ is the scattering operator encoding the interferometer's causal structure. Step 3: [Calculate fringe visibility] Fringe visibility $V$ is determined by the coherence of the causal network, which depends on the network coherence scale $l_P$ and the causal coupling $g_C$. The visibility is given by: \\[V = \\frac{g_C}{\\sqrt{1 + (\\frac{\\Delta \\tau}{l_P})^2}}\\] where $\\Delta \\tau$ is the proper time delay between the photon's paths in the network. For a balanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer, $\\Delta \\tau \\approx 0$, simplifying to: \\[V = g_C\\] The causal coupling $g_C$ is a dimensionless parameter representing the strength of causal connections in the network, typically close to 1 for coherent quantum systems."}
