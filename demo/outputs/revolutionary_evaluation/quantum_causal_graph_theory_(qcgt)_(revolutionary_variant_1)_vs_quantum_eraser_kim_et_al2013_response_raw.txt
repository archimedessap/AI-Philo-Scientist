Here is the analysis of the quantum eraser experiment using Quantum Causal Graph Theory (QCGT):

{"derivation": "Step 1: Represent the entangled photon pair as a bipartite graph state |Ψ_G⟩ = (1/√2)(|H⟩_A|V⟩_B + |V⟩_A|H⟩_B), where A and B are vertices in the causal graph corresponding to the two photons. Step 2: The double-slit with polarization tagging creates a which-path superposition |ψ⟩ = (1/√2)(|H⟩|path1⟩ + |V⟩|path2⟩), where path states correspond to additional vertices in the graph. Step 3: The eraser operation is modeled as a local graph update U_eraser = (1/√2)(|H⟩⟨H| + |V⟩⟨V|) acting on vertex B, which creates new edges in the causal graph. Step 4: The fringe visibility is calculated from the decoherence functional Γ = ⟨ψ|D[ρ_G]|ψ⟩ where D[ρ_G] = γ∑_v(I_v - ⟨I_v⟩) is the graph decoherence operator. Step 5: For the erased case, the visibility is V = |Tr[ρ_G U_eraser]| = |(1/2)(e^{iα} + e^{-iα})| = cos(α), where α ≈ 1/4 is the quantum geometric coupling constant. Step 6: With the given parameters α ≈ 0.25 and γ ≈ 10^-46 s^-1, the predicted visibility is V = cos(0.25) ≈ 0.9689."}
