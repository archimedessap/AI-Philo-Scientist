Here is the analysis of the Wheeler delayed-choice experiment using Topo-Contextual Quantum Measure Theory (TCQMT):

{"derivation": "Step 1: Define the contextual measurement space for the Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with two contexts: \u03b1 (beam splitter present) and \u03b2 (beam splitter absent). The topological coupling strength \u03bb = h/2\u03c0\u2113_c sets the scale for context transitions. Step 2: The photon state is represented as a sheaf section \u03a8(\u03b1) = (1/\u221a2)(|0\u27e9 + e^{i\u03d5}|1\u27e9) in context \u03b1 (interference) and \u03a8(\u03b2) = |0\u27e9 or |1\u27e9 in context \u03b2 (which-path). Step 3: The transition probability between contexts is given by TCQMT measurement rule: P(\u03b1\u2192\u03b2) = |\u27e8\u03a8_\u03b1|\u03a8_\u03b2\u27e9|^2 / \u2135(\u03b1,\u03b2) \u00d7 \u03c7(\u03b1,\u03b2). Step 4: Calculate the Grothendieck pairing \u2135(\u03b1,\u03b2) = \u222b_C d\u03bc(\u03b1) = 1 (normalized measure on context space). Step 5: The topological factor \u03c7(\u03b1,\u03b2) = exp(-\u03bb\u0394x/\u2113_c) where \u0394x is the path difference. For MZI with equal arms, \u03c7(\u03b1,\u03b2) = 1. Step 6: The fringe visibility V is the contrast between interference and which-path measurements: V = |P(\u03b1) - P(\u03b2)|/(P(\u03b1) + P(\u03b2)) = |1 - 0.5|/(1 + 0.5) = 1/3. Step 7: Including the quantum RNG choice timing, the effective visibility becomes V_eff = V \u00d7 (1 - e^{-t/\u03c4}) where t is the photon transit time and \u03c4 = \u2113_c/c. For typical nanoscale \u2113_c and optical paths, t/\u03c4 \u2248 0, giving V_eff \u2248 V."}
{"value": 0.33}

The derivation shows how TCQMT predicts fringe visibility through:
1) Contextual representation of measurement choices
2) Topological transition factors between contexts
3) Sheaf-valued probability structure
4) Non-Kolmogorov normalization via Grothendieck pairing
The final value 0.33 reflects the fundamental contextuality of the measurement topology in this framework.
