{"derivation": "Step 1: Represent the entangled photon pair as a quantum causal network state |\\Phi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|H\\rangle_1|V\\rangle_2 + |V\\rangle_1|H\\rangle_2), where |H\\rangle and |V\\rangle are orthogonal polarization states. The subscripts 1,2 label the photons. This state encodes non-local causal relations between the photons. Step 2: Model the double-slit with polarization tagging as a causal scattering process \\hat{S}_{slit} = |H\\rangle\\langle H| \\otimes \\hat{T}_1 + |V\\rangle\\langle V| \\otimes \\hat{T}_2, where \\hat{T}_1, \\hat{T}_2 are translation operators for paths through slits 1 and 2. The which-path information is encoded in the polarization-state causal correlations. Step 3: The eraser measurement is a causal projection \\hat{P}_{eraser} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|H\\rangle\\langle H| + |V\\rangle\\langle V|) applied to photon 2. This modifies the network connectivity, removing the which-path information from the causal relations. Step 4: Compute the fringe visibility as V = \\frac{P_{max} - P_{min}}{P_{max} + P_{min}} where P_{max/min} are extremal values of the detection probability P(\\theta) = |\\langle \\theta|\\hat{S}_{total}|\\Phi\\rangle|^2, with \\hat{S}_{total} = \\hat{P}_{eraser}\\hat{S}_{slit} and |\\theta\\rangle a detection state. Step 5: For the erased case, calculation yields V = \\cos(\\phi), where \\phi is the phase difference between paths. For perfect erasure, \\phi = 0 and V = 1. The non-erased case gives V = 0 due to complete which-path information."}
