{"derivation": "Step 1: Initialize the Hilbert sheaf for the entangled photon pair system. The state space is a sheaf of 2D Hilbert spaces (polarization states) glued by quantum geometric constraints: \\mathcal{H}_t = \\mathcal{H}_{A} \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_{B}, where \\mathcal{H}_{A/B} are the polarization spaces for photons A/B. Step 2: The core Hamiltonian for the system includes the quantum geometric coupling term: \\hat{H} = \\hat{H}_{QFT} + \\kappa \\hat{G}_{\\mu\\nu}\\otimes\\hat{R}^{\\mu\\nu} + \\lambda\\hat{T}. Here, \\hat{H}_{QFT} describes the free photon fields, \\kappa \\hat{G}_{\\mu\\nu}\\otimes\\hat{R}^{\\mu\\nu} encodes the quantum geometric entanglement, and \\lambda\\hat{T} accounts for topological flux due to the double-slit setup. Step 3: The initial entangled state is \\Psi_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|H_A V_B\\rangle + |V_A H_B\\rangle), where H/V denote horizontal/vertical polarization. Step 4: The double-slit tagging introduces a which-path operator \\hat{W} = |H\\rangle\\langle H| - |V\\rangle\\langle V|, which couples to the quantum geometric term in \\hat{H}. Step 5: The eraser measurement is modeled as a topological transition in \\mathcal{H}_t, changing the Euler characteristic \\Delta\\chi_t. The fringe visibility is given by the measurement rule: \\langle \\mathcal{O} \\rangle = \\text{Tr}_{\\mathcal{H}_t}\\left(\\rho_t\\hat{O}\\right) \\times \\exp\\left(-\\Delta\\chi_t\\right). Step 6: For the erased case, \\Delta\\chi_t = 0 (no which-path information), yielding maximum visibility. For the no-eraser case, \\Delta\\chi_t = \\ln(2) (which-path information present), reducing visibility by a factor of 1/2."}
