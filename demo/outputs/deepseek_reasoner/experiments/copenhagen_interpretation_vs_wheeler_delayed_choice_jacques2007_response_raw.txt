{"derivation": "Step 1: The initial state of the single photon entering the Machâ€“Zehnder interferometer can be described by a wavefunction \\( \\psi_{in} = |0\\rangle + |1\\rangle \\), where \\( |0\\rangle \\) and \\( |1\\rangle \\) represent the two paths of the interferometer.\\n\\nStep 2: The evolution of the wavefunction through the first beam splitter (BS1) can be described by the unitary transformation: \\( \\hat{U}_{BS1} \\) such that \\( \\hat{U}_{BS1} \\psi_{in} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle) \\).\\n\\nStep 3: After passing through BS1, the state becomes a superposition of the two paths: \\( \\psi_{BS1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle) \\).\\n\\nStep 4: The photon then travels along the two paths and encounters the second beam splitter (BS2). The transformation at BS2 is given by \\( \\hat{U}_{BS2} \\), which mixes the two paths: \\( \\hat{U}_{BS2} \\psi_{BS1} = \\frac{1}{2} (|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle + |2\\rangle + |3\\rangle) \\), where \\( |2\\rangle \\) and \\( |3\\rangle \\) represent the output modes of the interferometer.\\n\\nStep 5: The choice device (electro-optic modulator) can either insert or remove the output beam splitter, affecting the interference pattern. If the output beam splitter is present, the final state is a superposition leading to interference. If it is absent, the paths are distinguishable, and no interference occurs.\\n\\nStep 6: The visibility of the interference fringe is defined as \\( V = \\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}} \\), where \\( I_{max} \\) and \\( I_{min} \\) are the maximum and minimum intensities of the detected photons.\\n\\nStep 7: In the case of interference (output beam splitter present), we have \\( I_{max} = 1 \\) and \\( I_{min} = 0 \\), leading to visibility \\( V = \\frac{1 - 0}{1 + 0} = 1 \\).\\n\\nStep 8: In the case without interference (output beam splitter absent), we have \\( I_{max} = 0.5 \\) and \\( I_{min} = 0.5 \\), leading to visibility \\( V = \\frac{0.5 - 0.5}{0.5 + 0.5} = 0 \\).\\n\\nStep 9: The final visibility depends on the choice made by the quantum random number generator (RNG) after the photon has entered the interferometer. The experiment shows that the choice made after the photon has entered the interferometer still affects the fringe visibility, consistent with the Copenhagen interpretation where measurement affects the outcome.\\n\\nStep 10: Therefore, the predicted fringe visibility for the delayed choice experiment can be either 1 or 0, depending on whether the output beam splitter is present or absent."}
