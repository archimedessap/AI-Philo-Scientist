{"derivation": "Step 1: The initial state of the electron can be described by a wavefunction \\( \\psi(x, t) \\) that evolves according to the Schr√∂dinger equation: \\[ i\\hbar\\,\\partial_t\\,\\psi = H_{QM}\\,\\psi \\] where the Hamiltonian \\( H_{QM} \\) is given by \\[ H_{QM} = \\sum_i \\frac{\\hat{p}_i^2}{2m_i} + V(\\{\\hat{r}_i\\}) \\] For a free electron, the potential energy term \\( V \\) can be neglected, leading to the kinetic energy Hamiltonian. \\[ H_{QM} = \\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2m} \\] Step 2: The wavefunction for a free particle can be expressed as a plane wave: \\[ \\psi(x, t) = A e^{i(kx - \\omega t)} \\] where \\( k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} \\) is the wave number and \\( \\omega = \\frac{\\hbar k^2}{2m} \\) is the angular frequency. Step 3: In the double-slit experiment, the electron passes through two slits, leading to a superposition of states. The total wavefunction can be expressed as: \\[ \\psi_{total}(x, t) = \\psi_1(x, t) + \\psi_2(x, t) \\] where \\( \\psi_1 \\) and \\( \\psi_2 \\) correspond to the wavefunctions passing through slit 1 and slit 2, respectively. Step 4: The probability density for detecting the electron on the screen is given by: \\[ P(x) = |\\psi_{total}(x, t)|^2 = |\\psi_1(x, t)|^2 + |\\psi_2(x, t)|^2 + 2\\text{Re}(\\psi_1^*(x, t)\\psi_2(x, t)) \\] Step 5: The interference term arises from the overlap of the two wavefunctions, leading to the visibility of the fringes. The fringe visibility \\( V \\) is defined as: \\[ V = \\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}} \\] where \\( I_{max} \\) and \\( I_{min} \\) are the maximum and minimum intensities observed on the screen. Step 6: For a double-slit experiment with equal amplitudes, we can set \\( |\\psi_1| = |\\psi_2| = A \\). Thus, the intensities are: \\[ I_{max} = |2A|^2 = 4|A|^2 \\] \\[ I_{min} = |0|^2 = 0 \\] Step 7: Substituting these into the visibility equation gives: \\[ V = \\frac{4|A|^2 - 0}{4|A|^2 + 0} = 1 \\] Step 8: The predicted fringe visibility for this experiment is therefore 1, indicating perfect visibility of the interference pattern."}
