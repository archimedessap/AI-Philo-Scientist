{"derivation": "Step 1: In the quantum eraser experiment, we start with a pair of polarization-entangled photons. The state of the system can be represented as \\( \\psi = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|HH\\rangle + |VV\\rangle) \\), where \\( |H\\rangle \\) and \\( |V\\rangle \\) denote horizontal and vertical polarization states, respectively. This state is prepared such that one photon goes through a double-slit setup while the other is sent to a polarization measurement device.\\n\\nStep 2: The double-slit setup has two slits, each tagged by orthogonal polarizations. For instance, let slit 1 correspond to horizontal polarization (H) and slit 2 to vertical polarization (V). When the first photon passes through the slits, it can be described by the superposition of paths: \\( \\psi_{path} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|1\\rangle + |2\\rangle) \\), where \\( |1\\rangle \\) and \\( |2\\rangle \\) represent the photon taking path 1 and path 2, respectively.\\n\\nStep 3: The overall state of the system after passing through the slits becomes \\( \\psi_{total} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|1H\\rangle + |2V\\rangle) \\). Here, the polarization of the second photon is entangled with the path of the first photon.\\n\\nStep 4: If we measure the polarization of the second photon (the partner photon), we can obtain which-path information. If we measure it to be horizontal (H), we know the first photon went through slit 1, and if we measure it to be vertical (V), it went through slit 2. This measurement collapses the wavefunction according to the projection postulate: \\( \\psi \\to \\Pi_{H} \\psi \\) or \\( \\psi \\to \\Pi_{V} \\psi \\).\\n\\nStep 5: In the case where we do not erase the which-path information, the interference pattern is lost, and the visibility of the fringes is given by \\( V = 0 \\).\\n\\nStep 6: If we apply the eraser method by measuring the polarization of the second photon in a basis that does not distinguish between H and V (e.g., diagonal polarization), we can restore the interference pattern. The state collapses to a superposition that allows for interference: \\( \\psi_{eraser} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|D\\rangle + |A\\rangle) \\), where \\( |D\\rangle \\) and \\( |A\\rangle \\) are diagonal and anti-diagonal polarizations.\\n\\nStep 7: The fringe visibility can be calculated using the formula \\( V = \\frac{I_{max} - I_{min}}{I_{max} + I_{min}} \\). In the case of full interference restoration, we have \\( I_{max} = 1 \\) and \\( I_{min} = 0 \\), leading to \\( V = \\frac{1 - 0}{1 + 0} = 1 \\).\\n\\nStep 8: Therefore, the predicted fringe visibility for the quantum eraser experiment is \\( V = 1 \\), indicating complete restoration of the interference pattern when the which-path information is erased."}
