{"derivation": "Step 1: Initial state after first beam splitter (BS1). A single photon entering the interferometer becomes a superposition: $|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)$, where $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ represent the two paths. This follows unitary Schr√∂dinger evolution under the beam splitter Hamiltonian. Step 2: Introduce relative phase $\\phi$ in one arm (for visibility measurement). The state becomes $|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|0\\rangle + e^{i\\phi}|1\\rangle)$. Step 3: Case for closed configuration (BS2 inserted). The second beam splitter (BS2) applies unitary transformation: $|0\\rangle \\mapsto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|D_1\\rangle + |D_2\\rangle)$, $|1\\rangle \\mapsto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|D_1\\rangle - |D_2\\rangle)$. The state evolves to: $|\\psi_{\\text{closed}}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (1 + e^{i\\phi}) |D_1\\rangle + (1 - e^{i\\phi}) |D_2\\rangle \\right]$. Step 4: Compute detection probability at $D_1$. Born rule gives $P_{D_1}(\\phi) = \\left| \\langle D_1 | \\psi_{\\text{closed}} \\rangle \\right|^2 = \\left| \\frac{1 + e^{i\\phi}}{2} \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\left| 1 + \\cos\\phi + i\\sin\\phi \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{4} (2 + 2\\cos\\phi) = \\frac{1 + \\cos\\phi}{2}$. Step 5: Calculate fringe visibility $V$. Intensity $I(\\phi) = P_{D_1}(\\phi)$. Maximum intensity $I_{\\text{max}} = \\max_\\phi I(\\phi) = 1$ (at $\\phi = 0$), minimum $I_{\\text{min}} = \\min_\\phi I(\\phi) = 0$ (at $\\phi = \\pi$). Thus $V = \\frac{I_{\\text{max}} - I_{\\text{min}}}{I_{\\text{max}} + I_{\\text{min}}}} = \\frac{1 - 0}{1 + 0} = 1$. Step 6: Address delayed choice. The quantum RNG choice occurs after photon entry but before detection. In Copenhagen interpretation, the wavefunction evolves unitarily until measurement. For closed configuration cases (50% probability), the above derivation holds. The delayed choice does not affect the unitary evolution or visibility calculation for the closed cases, as collapse only occurs at photon detection."}
