  "summary": "Objective Collapse theories, exemplified by the GRW model, propose that wave function collapse is a real, physical process that happens spontaneously and randomly for all particles, independent of measurement or observers. The Schrödinger equation is modified to include a non-linear, stochastic term that causes the wave function of any single particle to spontaneously localize in space at a certain rate. For microscopic systems, this is exceedingly rare, but for macroscopic objects (containing billions of particles), the collective effect ensures an almost instantaneous collapse, thus explaining the emergence of a classical world.",

    {
      "principle": "Unified Dynamics",
      "statement": "There is only one universal dynamical law that governs all physical systems, microscopic and macroscopic. This law is a stochastic modification of the Schrödinger equation.",
      "implication": "Rejects the dualism of unitary evolution and measurement collapse from the Copenhagen interpretation. The 'measurement problem' is solved because the measurement apparatus, being macroscopic, is forced to a definite state by the dynamics itself."

      "principle": "Spontaneous Localization",
      "statement": "Every elementary particle has a tiny, constant probability per unit time of spontaneously having its wave function multiplied by a Gaussian function, localizing it in space.",
      "implication": "Collapse is a fundamental physical process, not an emergent one. This introduces two new fundamental constants of nature: the collapse rate (λ) and the localization width (r_c)."

    {
      "principle": "Amplification Mechanism",
      "statement": "For a composite system of many particles, the collapse rate of the system as a whole is the sum of the rates of its constituents. This means macroscopic objects collapse almost instantaneously.",
      "implication": "Provides a dynamical explanation for why macroscopic objects are always in definite states, while microscopic objects can remain in superposition for long periods."
