      "generation_prompt_summary": "A family of interpretations originating with Bas van Fraassen in 1972, with significant versions developed by Kochen, Dieks, and others. They aim to specify which properties of a quantum system are definite or 'actual' at any given time, without invoking collapse."

  },
  "summary": "Modal interpretations propose a distinction between a system's 'dynamical state' (the wave function Ψ), which describes its possible properties, and its 'value state', which describes its actual, definite properties. The wave function always evolves unitarily according to the Schrödinger equation, so there is no collapse. At any given time, a system possesses a set of definite properties, determined by a 'property-ascription rule' based on the instantaneous state of the wave function (e.g., its spectral decomposition). This provides a form of realism without contradicting the Kochen-Specker theorem, which forbids assigning definite values to all properties simultaneously.",

    {
      "principle": "Dual State Description",
      "statement": "A system is described by two states: the dynamical state (Ψ), which evolves unitarily and determines what *can* be, and the value state, which specifies what properties the system *actually has* at a given moment.",
      "implication": "The wave function is not a complete description of what is actual, only what is possible."
    },
    {
      "principle": "No Collapse Dynamics",
      "statement": "The dynamical state Ψ always evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. The 'measurement problem' is dissolved because measurements simply reveal the pre-existing, actual properties of the system.",
      "implication": "This avoids the conceptual difficulties of the collapse postulate."
    },
    {
      "principle": "Property Ascription Rule",
      "statement": "There is a specific rule, based on the mathematical form of the wave function (e.g., the Schmidt decomposition for bipartite systems), that selects which observables have definite values.",
      "implication": "Realism is selective. Only a subset of a system's properties are definite at any time, in a way that is compatible with the quantum formalism."
