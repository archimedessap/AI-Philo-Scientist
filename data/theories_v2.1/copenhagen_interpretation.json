  "summary": "The Copenhagen interpretation is the orthodox view of quantum mechanics, asserting that quantum systems are described by a wave function which provides probabilities for measurement outcomes. The act of measurement causes an instantaneous, non-deterministic 'collapse' of the wave function, and properties like position or momentum do not have definite values until measured. It emphasizes the principle of complementarity and the essential role of the classical measurement apparatus.",

      "principle": "Wave Function Completeness",
      "statement": "The wave function Ψ provides a complete probabilistic description of a quantum system.",
      "implication": "Rejects the existence of 'hidden variables' or a deeper, deterministic reality."
    },
    {
      "principle": "Wave Function Collapse",
      "statement": "Upon measurement by a classical apparatus, the wave function undergoes an instantaneous, non-unitary, and probabilistic collapse to an eigenstate corresponding to the measured value.",
      "implication": "Introduces a fundamental division between quantum evolution (Schrödinger equation) and measurement evolution (collapse)."
    },
    {
      "principle": "Complementarity",
      "statement": "Certain pairs of properties (e.g., position and momentum) are complementary and cannot be simultaneously known or have definite values. The experimental context determines which property can be observed.",
      "implication": "A single, classical picture of reality is impossible. Both wave-like and particle-like aspects are necessary for a full description, but they are mutually exclusive in any single experiment."
