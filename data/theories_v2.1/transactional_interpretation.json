  "summary": "The Transactional Interpretation views a quantum event as the result of a 'transaction' between an emitter and an absorber. The emitter sends out a retarded 'offer wave' (the standard wave function Ψ) forward in time. Potential absorbers respond with an advanced 'confirmation wave' (the complex conjugate Ψ*) backward in time. A transaction is completed, leading to the exchange of energy and momentum, only when the offer and confirmation waves create a 'handshake' that satisfies the boundary conditions. This process happens outside of normal time, in a 'pseudo-time'.",

    {
      "principle": "Offer and Confirmation Waves",
      "statement": "Any quantum emission involves both a retarded wave (Ψ) moving forward in time and an advanced wave (Ψ*) moving backward in time.",
      "implication": "The standard wave function is only half the story. Its complex conjugate has an equal physical reality, propagating into the past."
    },
    {
      "principle": "The Transaction",
      "statement": "A quantum event (e.g., photon absorption) is finalized through a 'handshake' between the offer wave from the emitter and the confirmation wave from the absorber.",
      "implication": "This explains the Born rule: the strength of the confirmation wave from an absorber is proportional to the amplitude of the offer wave at that absorber, so the probability of a transaction completing is |Ψ*Ψ| = |Ψ|²."
    },
    {
      "principle": "Acausal Handshake",
      "statement": "The formation of a transaction is a global, atemporal process that stands outside of the usual temporal sequence of events.",
      "implication": "It resolves non-locality paradoxes by making the entire interaction, including its future boundary conditions (the absorbers), a single, indivisible event."

    "epistemology": {
      "role_of_observer": "The observer's measurement apparatus is simply one possible 'absorber'. The observer does not cause collapse, but their presence provides a boundary condition that enables a transaction to complete.",
      "nature_of_probability": "Objective. The probability of a transaction is determined by the wave amplitudes, reflecting the 'strength' of the potential handshake."

    "key_questions": {
      "determinism": "Non-deterministic, as there may be multiple potential absorbers, and the transaction probabilistically 'chooses' one.",
