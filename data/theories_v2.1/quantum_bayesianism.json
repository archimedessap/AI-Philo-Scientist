  "summary": "QBism argues that quantum mechanics is not a direct description of an objective reality, but rather a normative theory that any rational agent should use to update their personal beliefs about the outcomes of future experiences. The wave function Ψ is not real; it is a mathematical object encoding an agent's subjective degrees of belief (credences) about the consequences of their actions on a system. The 'collapse' is simply the agent updating their beliefs based on a new experience (a measurement outcome), in accordance with Bayesian probability rules.",

    {
      "principle": "Subjective Bayesian Probability",
      "statement": "All probabilities, including those in quantum mechanics, are subjective degrees of belief held by an agent. They do not represent objective features of the world.",
      "implication": "The Born rule is not a law of nature, but a normative rule for how an agent should assign probabilities to the outcomes of their interventions."
    },
    {
      "principle": "Primacy of the Agent",
      "statement": "Quantum mechanics is a 'single-user' theory. Its formulas are tools for a single agent to navigate their world. The wave function is specific to the agent who assigns it.",
      "implication": "Paradoxes like Wigner's Friend are dissolved, as there is no single, shared 'fact of the matter'. Wigner and his friend simply have different subjective beliefs, and neither is more 'correct' than the other."
    },
    {
      "principle": "Experience as Fundamental",
      "statement": "The outcome of a measurement is a personal experience for the agent. The world presents a source of novelty and unpredictability that the agent responds to.",
      "implication": "QBism is non-solipsistic. It posits a real world external to the agent, but claims quantum mechanics only describes the agent's interaction with it, not the world itself."

      "role_of_observer": "The agent/observer is the central subject of the theory. Quantum mechanics is a user's manual for observers.",
      "nature_of_probability": "Purely subjective (epistemic). A probability of 1 or 0 represents an agent's certainty about a future experience."
    },
    "key_questions": {
      "determinism": "The theory is silent on the determinism of the external world. It is non-deterministic from the agent's perspective, as the world can always surprise them.",
      "locality": "Radically local. The 'collapse' of a wave function happens only in the mind of the agent who made the measurement. Since the wave function was never a real, physical field spread across space, its update does not imply any non-local physical influence.",
      "realism": "Anti-realist about the wave function and quantum states. It is realist only about the agent's personal experiences."
