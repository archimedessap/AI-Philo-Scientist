      "parents": ["Many-Worlds Interpretation", "Special Relativity"],

  "summary": "Spacetime State Realism is a modern development of the Many-Worlds Interpretation. It posits that the fundamental ontology of the world is a field defined on the four-dimensional spacetime manifold. This field, often called the 'mass-energy density' or similar, is what is 'real'. The quantum state is a mathematical object that describes the properties and dynamics of this spacetime-based ontology. The 'branching' of worlds is interpreted as the decoherence of this field into a complex pattern of quasi-classical, branching structures within spacetime.",

      "principle": "Spacetime Ontology",
      "statement": "The fundamental 'stuff' of the world exists in 4D spacetime, not in an abstract high-dimensional configuration space.",
      "implication": "This makes the theory's ontology more compatible with other areas of physics like General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory, and more intuitive."
    },
    {
      "principle": "Quantum State as Descriptive",
      "statement": "The quantum state is a tool that describes the behavior of the real stuff in spacetime. The state itself is not the fundamental ontology.",
      "implication": "This reverses the standard MWI view. Instead of the wave function being primary and worlds emerging from it, the spacetime fields are primary and the wave function describes them."
    },
    {
      "principle": "Emergent Branching",
      "statement": "The branching structure of MWI is an emergent, large-scale feature of the dynamics of the spacetime fields, made stable by decoherence.",
      "implication": "There is no literal 'splitting' of universes, but rather a continuous process where a complex field pattern evolves into distinct, non-interacting braids or branches."
