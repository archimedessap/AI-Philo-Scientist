  "summary": "The Consistent Histories approach reformulates quantum mechanics in terms of 'histories,' which are sequences of properties at different points in time. It provides a formal criterion (the consistency condition) to determine which sets of histories can be assigned classical probabilities. Within a consistent set (or 'framework'), standard logic and probability theory apply. The theory asserts that it is meaningless to combine or compare histories from different, incompatible frameworks. There is no wave function collapse, and the framework chosen for analysis depends on the questions being asked.",

      "principle": "Consistency Condition",
      "statement": "Probabilities can only be assigned to a set of histories if they are 'consistent,' meaning there is negligible interference between different histories in the set.",

      "statement": "All physical reasoning must be conducted within a single, self-consistent framework (a consistent set of histories). It is forbidden to combine results from incompatible frameworks.",
