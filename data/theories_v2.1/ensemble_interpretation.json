  "summary": "The Ensemble Interpretation, or Statistical Interpretation, asserts that the wave function Ψ does not apply to an individual quantum system but only to an 'ensemble' of many similarly prepared systems. The probabilistic predictions of quantum mechanics are therefore interpreted as standard statistical frequencies within this ensemble. This view resolves many paradoxes by denying that a single particle has a wave function, thus there is no collapse for a single system and no concept of a particle being in a superposition.",

      "principle": "Ensemble-Only Description",
      "statement": "The quantum state (wave function) is a mathematical description of a conceptual ensemble of identically prepared systems, not a description of a single system.",
      "implication": "A single particle does not have a wave function. It is meaningless to ask about the state of a single particle beyond its actual, possessed properties."
    },
    {
      "principle": "Statistical Probabilities",
      "statement": "Quantum probabilities are standard statistical probabilities, representing the frequency of obtaining a certain measurement result over the ensemble.",
      "implication": "This removes the 'special' status of quantum probability. The Born rule is simply a statement about statistical distributions."
    },
    {
      "principle": "Realism about Particles",
      "statement": "Individual particles are real and always possess definite (though perhaps unknown) properties. Quantum mechanics is simply incomplete as a description of a single system.",
      "implication": "The theory is inherently compatible with the idea of 'hidden variables' that would, if known, provide a complete, deterministic description of the individual system."

    "key_questions": {
      "determinism": "The theory is agnostic about the determinism of the underlying reality of single systems. It is compatible with, and often implicitly assumes, an underlying deterministic hidden-variable theory.",
