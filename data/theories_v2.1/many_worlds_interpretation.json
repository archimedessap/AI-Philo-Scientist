  "summary": "The Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) posits that the universal wave function is objectively real and there is no wave function collapse. Instead, every quantum measurement leads to a splitting of the universe into a multitude of parallel universes, one for each possible outcome of the measurement. All possible outcomes of a quantum measurement are realized, but in different, non-communicating 'worlds' or branches of the universal wave function.",

    {
      "principle": "Universal Wave Function Realism",
      "statement": "The entire universe is described by a single, all-encompassing wave function Ψ_U which is objectively real.",
      "implication": "The wave function is not just a tool for calculation; it *is* the fundamental reality."
    },
    {
      "principle": "Unitary Evolution Only",
      "statement": "The universal wave function evolves deterministically at all times according to the Schrödinger equation. There is no separate, non-unitary collapse process.",
      "implication": "Eliminates the measurement problem and the need for a 'Heisenberg cut' between the quantum and classical realms. Measurement is just another quantum interaction."
    },
    {
      "principle": "Branching Worlds",
      "statement": "During an interaction that constitutes a measurement, the wave function decoheres into stable, non-interacting branches, each representing a consistent, classical-like world with a definite measurement outcome.",
      "implication": "The universe is constantly splitting. All possible outcomes occur, but observers in any given branch only experience one specific outcome."

    "epistemology": {
      "role_of_observer": "The observer is a complex quantum system, fully described by the wave function. The observer's state becomes entangled with the measured system, leading to the observer's consciousness also branching.",
      "nature_of_probability": "Probability is interpreted as the subjective uncertainty of an observer about which branch they will find themselves in post-measurement. The Born rule probabilities are proposed to arise from self-locating uncertainty or counting measures over branches, though this is a point of contention (the 'preferred basis problem')."

    "key_questions": {
      "determinism": "Fully deterministic at the level of the universal wave function's evolution.",
      "locality": "Local, as the Schrödinger equation is a local differential equation. Apparent non-locality (EPR) is explained by pre-existing correlations that are revealed across different branches.",
      "realism": "Strongly realist. The wave function is real, and all its components (branches) are equally real."
