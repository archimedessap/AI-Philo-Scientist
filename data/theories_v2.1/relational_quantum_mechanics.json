      "method": "human_authored",
      "parents": ["Copenhagen Interpretation", "Special Relativity"],
      "generation_prompt_summary": "Proposed by Carlo Rovelli in 1996, RQM is an interpretation that treats the quantum state of a system as a relation between the system and an observer, rather than an absolute property of the system itself."

  "summary": "Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM) asserts that the state of a quantum system is observer-dependent. That is, the state is a relation between an observer and the system. A system's properties only become definite during an interaction with another system (the observer), and this description is only valid for that specific observer. There is no absolute, universal wave function or state. All systems are quantum systems, and 'measurement' is just a standard physical interaction between two such systems.",
  
  "core_principles": [
    {
      "principle": "State is Relational",
      "statement": "The state of a system S is always relative to an observer O. It is meaningless to speak of the absolute state of S.",
      "implication": "Different observers can give different, correct accounts of the state of the same system. The wave function is a description of the correlation between a system and an observer."
    },
    {
      "principle": "Observer is any System",
      "statement": "Any physical system can be an 'observer'. There is no fundamental distinction between observer and observed.",
      "implication": "This eliminates the need for a 'Heisenberg cut' and avoids the paradoxes associated with conscious observers (like Wigner's Friend)."
    },
    {
      "principle": "Information via Interaction",
      "statement": "All physical facts are established through interactions. A system acquires properties relative to another system only when they interact.",
      "implication": "A system has no definite properties in isolation. The 'collapse' of the wave function is simply the updating of an observer's information about a system after an interaction."

    "epistemology": {
      "role_of_observer": "The observer is any system that interacts with the system of interest. The description of the world is a network of relations.",
      "nature_of_probability": "Probabilities arise from the inherent indeterminacy of future interactions. They quantify the likelihood of a system actualizing a property relative to an observer in a future interaction."
    },
    "key_questions": {
      "determinism": "Non-deterministic. The outcome of any interaction is fundamentally probabilistic.",
      "locality": "Local. Interactions are local events. Non-local correlations (EPR) are resolved by recognizing that there is no shared, absolute set of facts. Alice's interaction with her particle establishes a fact relative to her, and Bob's interaction does the same relative to him. The correlation lies in the consistency of their relational descriptions.",
      "realism": "A form of 'relational realism'. It is realist about the network of relations and the information obtained in interactions, but anti-realist about observer-independent states or properties."
