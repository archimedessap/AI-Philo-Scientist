  "summary": "De Broglie-Bohm theory, or pilot-wave theory, is a deterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics. It posits that in addition to the wave function, every particle has a definite, real position at all times. The wave function, evolving according to the Schrödinger equation, acts as a 'pilot wave' that guides the motion of the particles via a guidance equation. There is no wave function collapse; all measurement outcomes are predetermined by the initial positions of the particles and the wave function.",

      "principle": "Ontological Duality",
      "statement": "The complete state of a system is described by two fundamental entities: the wave function Ψ and the actual configuration of particles Q.",

      "principle": "Deterministic Guidance",
      "statement": "The particles' motion is deterministically governed by a guidance equation, where their velocity is derived from the phase of the wave function.",

      "principle": "Unbroken Unitary Evolution",
      "statement": "The wave function always evolves smoothly and deterministically according to the Schrödinger equation. There is no measurement-induced collapse.",
      "implication": "The 'measurement problem' is solved by asserting that measurements simply reveal the pre-existing positions of particles in the measurement apparatus."

      "role_of_observer": "The observer is a complex physical system like any other. Measurement is an interaction that reveals the pre-existing position of the system's particles, with the outcome being deterministic.",
      "nature_of_probability": "Probabilities are epistemic, reflecting our inability to know or prepare the exact initial positions of the particles. Given a distribution of initial positions that matches |Ψ(Q, t₀)|² (the 'quantum equilibrium hypothesis'), the theory reproduces the Born rule predictions for all subsequent times."
